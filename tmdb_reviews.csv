533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,"Its story may not be the strongest, but the comedy makes <em>'Deadpool & Wolverine'</em> an excellent watch!

There are some top notch gags in there, particularly to do with the recent offscreen changes for Wade Wilson's alter ego. As you'd expect with Ryan Reynolds in this role, the jokes are plentiful and there is barely any time to react to one before another appears. That can sometimes not work as well as intended, e.g. <em>'Deadpool 2'</em>, but here the humour is executed perfectly.

Reynolds himself is quality, it is a quintessential Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool performance. It's real neat to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, he does play second fiddle to the other titular character but still more than holds his own, as you'd expect. Emma Corrin, meanwhile, enters the MCU with a great showing.

As noted at the top, I do think the plot couldn't been superior - but not in a negative way. What is portrayed is still entertaining to watch, it's just not necessarily on the same level as the comedic elements. A fun watch, all the same. Do I like it more than the 2016 original? I think so, would only be minorly so though.",9.0
533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,"_Deadpool & Wolverine_ is the best the MCU has been since Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. It’s two hours of comic book-driven fan service and delivers entertaining surprises, nostalgic throwbacks, memorable action sequences, and worthwhile performances.

533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,"In moviemaking, sadly, there can be a problem with going to the well too many times, and this latest installment in one of filmdom’s better cinematic franchises verges on proving just that. This offering’s predecessors (2016, 2018) significantly distinguished themselves from the kind of fare typically found in the superhero genre with their outrageously bawdy humor, hilarious sight gags and relentlessly maverick attitude. This time out, however, director Shawn Levy’s latest effort is a decidedly hit or miss affair, with an often-incoherent script that feels like it was cobbled together from a collection of leftover parts, some of which work and some of which don’t. I suppose that’s not entirely surprising from a screenplay that was penned by four different writers, making me wonder how much consensus was in place in compiling the finished product. Moreover, this film appears to be intended to fold the Deadpool franchise into the X-Men franchise, an intriguing idea that, regrettably, is handled rather clumsily (as has often been the case with many other recent fusion offerings in the Marvel Universe). And, if all that weren’t bad enough, this release gives short shrift to the colorful cast of supporting players that made the Deadpool films so funny, original and enjoyable, relegating them to little more than cameos in favor of walk-ons by a host of other MCU characters (some of them remarkably obscure, I might add) in an attempt to help cement the franchise cross-pollination going on here. It makes for awkward storytelling at times, especially for viewers who might not be familiar with these lesser-known figures, some of which are drawn from Marvel source material unrelated to its big screen offerings. To the picture’s credit, it features yet another stellar turn by Ryan Reynolds as the off-color protagonist, as well as its share of hilarious bits (without a doubt the franchise’s historically strongest suit), including a number of unabashed, razor-sharp asides referencing off-screen developments related to the studios that produced these films and the actors who have appeared in them. These strengths notwithstanding, however, this is a production that has sadly watered down the elements that best made this franchise work in favor of an overarching programming agenda that simply doesn’t serve this film or the series particularly well. The creators would have served themselves and viewers better by sticking with what works and the basics of good storytelling than trying to force an issue for the sake of future productions that may or may not work over the long term. This has been a noticeable downfall in the quality of many of the most recent Marvel Universe releases, and I’d truly hate to see this franchise befall a similar fate.",6.0
533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,"Such a fun watch, maybe one of the best experiences I've had in a theater. I couldn't have asked for a better ending to 24 year old franchise.",10.0
533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,"Well the ""Deadpool"" concept is now well and truly immersed in the Marvel multi-verse and I really did fear for good old ""Dead"". More of the same? Well, no actually. Ryan Reynolds has reverted more to the occasionally quite vulgar humour of the first film (2016) and allowed this trequel to focus more on the personality of this irreverent, immortal, superhero as he tries to resurrect the recently departed ""Wolverine/Logan"" (Hugh Jackman) so he can save his timeline from erasure. To do that, and thwart the comically menacing ""Paradox"" (Matthew Macfadyen), he has to face down ""Cassandra Nova"" (Emma Corrin) - who happens to be the long estranged twin sister of ""Xavier"" who presides over the void. That's a ""Mad Max"" style desert style territory where all the undesirables have been put by ""Paradox"" and his organisation over the years. Initially, there's no love lost between our two heroes. The cocky man in red lycra does not impress his new, booze-soaked and guilt-ridden buddy, but quickly they manage to align their priorities and then - well yes, you can guess the rest. Indeed, there's nothing remotely unpredictable about any of this, but what it does do is shout loudly and proudly that it knows it. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel, it's succeeding in pointing out that all of these multi-verse films that simply adjust the space/time continuum to provide a new setting for the same old stories ad characters has to stop before we (the audience) bore further of their repetitive combat cycles and nondescript plot lines. Maybe Reynolds does over-egg the smuttiness a little but there are still plenty of wry comments about the industry, product placement and the plethora of films (and actors) that have preceded it delivering same old same old. It's not forgotten to entertain us too - there are loads of action scenes and there's an amiable chemistry between two actors who are clearly on the same, suitably sarcastic, page throughout a two hours that also features a some fun cameos from the likes of Messrs. Evans, Snipes, Cavill, Favreau and Tatum to keep it moving along with an effervescence of spirit. It's a big screen essential, there's a lot of effort gone into the production that won't work so well on the telly, and I enjoyed it.",7.0
533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,"Deadpool and Wolverine is a movie that I truly believe the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has needed for a while. After years of lackluster installments, this film is a breath of fresh air. Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and director Shawn Levy approached this project with care and a deep understanding of what fans want. The film feels like it was crafted by fans for fans, particularly those who have been frustrated by the recent phases of the MCU.

Reynolds and Levy brought on a team of writers with a strong background in comedy and storytelling. This decision pays off, as the film’s humor and narrative are both sharp and engaging. For example, the meta vibe of Deadpool, familiar from the previous two films, is ramped up significantly. The movie spares no one, making jokes about everything from Hugh Jackman’s recent divorce to Ryan Reynolds' career. However, it’s the MCU that receives the most pointed and critical jokes, which will resonate with long-time fans.

The chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is electric, bringing new life to both characters. Their dynamic is both hilarious and heartfelt, making for a compelling narrative. For instance, scenes where Deadpool and Wolverine banter while taking down enemies are filled with wit and energy, showcasing their unique bond. This camaraderie extends to the film’s supporting cast, with well-timed cameos and clever nods to previous Marvel movies.

The film's self-awareness and willingness to poke fun at its own franchise are refreshing. This level of meta-commentary sets the film apart from typical superhero fare.

Despite its comedic approach, the film doesn’t skimp on emotional depth. The storyline is carried by genuine heart, particularly in how it addresses themes of redemption and friendship. The climax is especially impactful, ranking among the greats in the franchise.

This isn't just a good sequel; it's a game-changer for the MCU. The film successfully integrates Deadpool into the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe while maintaining his unique tone and style. It sets the stage for future installments, promising exciting developments ahead. The way the film navigates these transitions feels seamless, ensuring that Deadpool’s irreverent humor doesn’t clash with the MCU’s established tone.

Overall, Deadpool and Wolverine is a standout entry in the MCU, offering a perfect blend of humor, action, and heart. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman deliver top-notch performances, supported by a smart script and deft direction from Shawn Levy. This film not only redeems past missteps in the franchise but also paves the way for a promising future. It’s a must-watch for any Marvel fan, filled with laughter, thrills, and touching moments that elevate it above many of its predecessors.",8.0
533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,"It feels a bit rushed... but then it was rushed.  It feels a bit neutered, but it's now Disney and they did muzzle it.

The thing is though... it's not woke, which is why you have articles criticizing it for ""Not Being Gay Enough"" and in 2024, that very literally translates to: ""They focused on a story and characters rather than a political agenda and we're mad about it."" Which, in turn, translates to ""Actually entertaining.""

It's amazing how articles complaining about a movie not being Gay enough can guarantee you that the movie is going to be good.

Only.... it's meh.  I mean, when you compare it to most of the movies this year it's pretty epic.  When you compare it to most of the post 2016 movies this is one of the greatest things ever made... but when you compare it to the other Deadpool movies it's rushed.

But... who cares, it literally doesn't have a point other than entertaining you, and that is really all that matters and all that I ask for.

Is it a cash grab? Yes, and I will GLADLY give them my money for another movie that just wants to entertain.  And if they make another movie that wants to entertain and not push an agenda, I will gladly give them MORE of my money... because at the end of the day, entertainment has been in a decade long drought brought to you by political lecturing and nerd domains have been intentionally attacking fans rather than making movies, like this, that make fans want to give them their money.

So when a movie like this comes along, it is a wonderful thing.",10.0
533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,"Satisfying and 100% fan-service. Hugh Jackman still is awesome as Wolverine and gives it his all, along with Ryan Reynolds, both showing passion for the characters. That said, much like Deadpool 2, I'm not sure if I have much desire to revisit anytime soon. **3.5/5**",7.0
533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,"I just watched Deadpool & Wolverine, and wow, it was an absolute blast! Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman have incredible chemistry that makes the whole movie work. Deadpool's irreverent humor and Wolverine's gruff seriousness balance each other perfectly. The film is packed with hilarious jokes, epic action sequences, and so many Easter eggs that comic book fans will be thrilled.

The opening sequence had me hooked right away, with a mix of intense fighting and Deadpool's signature humor. The constant fourth-wall breaks were spot-on and kept the laughs coming. It's a fantastic tribute to both characters and their histories, with plenty of nods to past films and comics.

If you're a fan of either character, this movie is a must-see. It's not just a fun ride; it's a love letter to the fans. The pacing is perfect, and the two hours flew by. Whether you're a casual viewer or a hardcore fan, Deadpool & Wolverine delivers on all fronts. Don't miss it!",10.0
533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,"For devout Marvel fans only.

Here is a test for franchise films: Remove the IP and characters to see if the story, character development, etc. stands on its own without using the IP as a crutch.
If you remove the IP in this case, you have absolutely nothing.

If you've seen a lot of previous Marvel films in this universe, you will be treated with an abundance of fan service. Admittedly, I have not watched a lot of these films. I have, however, watched the first two Deadpool entries. I enjoyed them at the time, especially the first one.

In this third entry, you will find a lot of cameos which are absolutely pointless, except for people to chug memberberries, as they do absolutely nothing with these characters. It doesn't even properly show the backstory of Wolverine.
This film is an almost non-stop barrage of bickering and snarky jokes, but it's never given any time at all to breathe. The few moments where it actually tries to convey emotion, it never truly lands, as all it wants to do is tell jokes. Did I laugh here and there? Sure. But I can count it on one hand.

The villain and plot quite forgettable, and you never truly feel that something's at stake, as the threat is mainly conveyed as a progress bar on a screen...

533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,"I went to see Deadpool & Wolverine last evening and boy did it feel refreshing to see Ryan Reynolds making all of these funny jokes on screen as Deadpool. There were a lot of mentions of Marvel, jokes about production companies & about production crew/cast (extras, etc). As someone who's passionate about this industry and is very active in the business, this film is a big success in my opinion. I loved that we got to see Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan in the intro of the film, just sad we didn't get a little Tony Stark (RDJ) appearance, but hey, it's not his movie after all (RIP Iron Man).",10.0
533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,"Finally, the moment I have been eagerly waiting for has arrived - the new film featuring Deadpool and Wolverine! I am thrilled to share my thoughts on this without revealing any spoilers, so brace yourself for a fairly tame review to keep the surprise intact for everyone.

Marvel is back in its element with this movie, as it takes a playful jab at itself. Deadpool boldly declares that the Multiverse is a mess and proposes putting an end to it - a refreshing take on the superhero genre.

The dance sequence is a hilarious throwback to the 90s, adding a touch of nostalgia and charm to the film. And yes, there is plenty of colorful language, including an abundance of the infamous F word - but then again, what else would you expect from Deadpool?

Prepare to be amazed by some incredible cameos that will leave you jumping out of your seat with excitement, especially if you have a soft spot for certain characters from the past. This movie is an absolute thrill ride that pays homage to the Fox universe and its beloved characters.

Without giving too much away, there is a surprising appearance by a fan-favorite character who never made it to the superhero league, and the moment is truly jaw-dropping. The storyline may seem chaotic, but that's all part of the Deadpool charm.

While the villain could have been utilized more effectively given their power, the relationship between Deadpool and Wolverine is beautifully portrayed. The film does a commendable job of explaining the backstory and the humor is on point, with Deadpool's witty jabs and references adding to the entertainment.

If you're a fan of Deadpool and his legacy, this movie is a must-watch that will blow your mind. Just be warned, there is a fair amount of profanity, so consider this if you're planning to bring along younger viewers. 

Overall, this movie was a blast and one of the most enjoyable Marvel experiences in recent memory. From the creative storytelling to the hilarious antics, it's a wild ride that you won't want to miss. And don't forget to stick around for the mid-credits and end-credits scenes for an extra dose of fun and closure to the film. Enjoy the laugh-filled ride!",9.0

There's also a sh*t load of profanity and bloody violence, so be aware of that as well. As long as you're not too squeamish, it should be a great flick.",

533535,Deadpool & Wolverine,"**Deadpool & Wolverine: A Comic Book Dream Realized**

From the very beginning, _Deadpool & Wolverine_ bursts onto the screen with the chaotic energy and irreverent humor fans have come to expect from the Merc with a Mouth. This film feels like a love letter to comic book enthusiasts, seamlessly blending the zany, fourth-wall-breaking antics of Deadpool with the gritty, emotionally charged presence of Wolverine. The movie captures the essence of reading a comic book, where big, crazy choices and wild action sequences keep you at the edge of your seat. The introduction of variants and a plethora of cameos from beloved characters across the Marvel Universe only enhances this feeling, making it a true spectacle for long-time fans.

Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine is nothing short of iconic, and this film allows him to fully embrace the character in ways we’ve longed to see. The sight of Wolverine finally donning his classic costume and charging on all fours is a visual treat that elicited cheers from the audience. Jackman’s performance is a testament to his deep connection with the character, proving once again why he's considered one of the best actors of our time.

Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool is as quippy and meta as ever, and the film strikes a delicate balance between humor and heart. The emotional depth is surprising, particularly in scenes where _Deadpool and Wolverine_ share poignant moments. One standout is Deadpool's farewell to Wolverine, which is both a nod to the characters' shared history and a poignant reminder of their enduring bond.

The film's action sequences are top-tier, with choreography that respects each character's unique fighting style. The inclusion of characters like Elektra, Blade, and even a hilarious cameo from Gambit adds layers of excitement and nostalgia. Wesley Snipes' return as Blade, complete with his signature line, ""Some motherfuckers always trying to ice-skate uphill,"" received one of the loudest reactions from the audience.

The story navigates the complexities of timelines and multiverse mechanics with a wink and a nod, never bogging down in overly technical explanations. This approach keeps the focus on the characters and their journeys, making for a more engaging and enjoyable experience.

_Deadpool & Wolverine_ isn't just a comic book movie; it's a celebration of the Marvel Universe's rich history and a heartfelt send-off to characters we've grown to love over the years. Whether you're a die-hard fan or a casual viewer, this film is an emotional whirlwind that invokes nostalgia and opens your heart to the possibilities you imagined as a kid. It's a fitting tribute to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and a testament to the enduring appeal of Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool. This movie is sure to be remembered as one of the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a true comic book dream realized on the big screen.",8.0

693134,Dune: Part Two,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://talkingfilms.net/dune-part-two-review-the-new-generational-epitome-of-sci-fi-epics/

""Dune: Part Two surpasses even the highest expectations, establishing itself as an unquestionable technical masterpiece of blockbuster filmmaking.

With a narrative that deepens the complex web of political relationships, power, faith, love, and destiny, it not only provides a breathtaking audiovisual spectacle, thanks to the genius of Denis Villeneuve, Greig Fraser, and Hans Zimmer, but it also offers a profound meditation on universal human themes through thematically rich world-building and thoroughly developed characters. The superb performances of the entire cast, led by a career-best Timothée Chalamet and a mesmerizing Zendaya, further elevate this incredibly immersive cinematic experience.

It warrants comparisons with the greatest sequels in history, easily becoming the new generational epitome of sci-fi epics.""

693134,Dune: Part Two,"As anticipated, a thrilling watch!

I enjoyed <em>'Dune'</em>, though remember thinking it was obviously a complete set-up to a sequel and that this would only improve upon its predecessor - and that's very much the case. <em>'Dune: Part Two'</em> is excellent! My interest did wane slightly at roughly the middle part, as was similarly the case with the first film in truth, but that was a feeling that only lasted for a relativiely short time.

All in all, it's fantastic. The acting is top notch, the visuals are breathtaking <em>(those sandworms tho)</em> and the score is outstandingly hefty - you can always rely on the great Hans Zimmer! Timothée Chalamet stars yet again, as do the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Dave Bautista & Co. The person I actually enjoyed most on screen was Javier Bardem, who is truly brilliant throughout. 

Bring on <em>'Dune Messiah'</em>! On that note, happy to read that director Denis Villeneuve has noted that he won't be rushing that one out - and rightly so!",9.0
693134,Dune: Part Two,"This is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective, almost industrially sounding, audio - but what happened to the story? It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2¾ hours. We pick up with ""Paul"" (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the ""Fremen"" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader ""Stilgar"" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give ""Jessica"" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on ""Chani"" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil ""Baron Harkonnen"" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsgård) has recruited his lethal nephew ""Feyd-Rautha"" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on ""Arrakis"" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of ""Khartoum"" (1966) and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) with a bit of the ""Phantom Menace"" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones. I still get distinctly squeamish when I watch what they do with the water, let alone where they get it from!!",7.0

There were a lot of stupid and logical fallacies. First, they show how dangerous those 'worms' are and run for life. Then they show you can actually 'tame' them like a cowboy, but with immense difficulty. Then you see the whole clan with tents, food, luggage, etc., riding them for traveling.

In terms of contextual cohesiveness and pacing I feel it did a better job, than its latter day counterpart. I believe with this effort they are going for sweeping epic but somehow it comes across as inexplicably pedestrian.

Yes cinematography is remarkable, as are CGI effects but the pacing is slow and things happen that don't come together all that well or give the sense that they are contributing, meaningfully, to the overall story. Acting is competent but again, its not remarkable, which I think is in part down to a lack of depth, in characterisations.

I know this review probably wont be popular or reflective of the mainstream but I sense they are trying to do too much and as a consequence, achieving too little.

693134,Dune: Part Two,"As a big sci-fi/fantasy fan, I generally look forward to seeing new releases in this genre. However, when the first part of this story was released in 2021, I was sorely disappointed by this tedious, overlong slog that, despite its stunning visuals and cinematography, never really engaged me. Though, for all my disappointment with the initial installment, it can’t begin to compare to my reaction to “Part Two” – an even more tedious, unengaging, overly complicated offering that had me bored by 20 minutes in. I found myself not caring a whit about the characters or their story (which could have used a scorecard to help viewers sort out everything), and even the supposedly superior visuals of this iteration failed to capture my attention or interest. I can only conclude that I must be missing something, given the generally positive reactions and accolades this film and its predecessor have received, but I’m mystified that I haven’t yet figured out what. By all rights, the elements would appear to be in place here to make this picture succeed – a stellar cast, great special effects and the skillful directing of filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, who created such excellent works as “Arrival” (2016) and “Blade Runner 2049” (2017) – but “Part Two,” like its predecessor, just never grabbed me. To be honest, I’m truly surprised that I made it all the way through, considering the nearly constant temptation to want to fast-forward through the egregiously dull sequences (of there were many). From all this, I can only surmise that this film and the one that preceded it were created simply to milk as much box office money as possible out of the source material, despite the fact that the story isn’t captivating enough to live up to that challenge. Indeed, if you’re like me and found the first part boring, you’ll probably find this one even more tiresome and lackluster (I’m certainly glad that I waited for this one to come to streaming and didn’t waste my money on theater ticket prices). And now, as I understand it, another sequel, “Dune: Messiah,” is in pre-production to continue a story that has still yet to reach conclusion after more than five hours of screentime. Be aware that the “Dune” films are far from the quality of other lengthy trilogies like the “Lord of the Rings” and “Dark Knight” series, films that definitely hold viewer interest from start to finish. Instead, “Dune” and “Dune: Part Two” are more like such mind-numbing stand-alone offerings as “Heaven’s Gate” (1980), “Ishtar” (1987) and “Tenet” (2020) than anything of a genuinely epic nature. Treat the hype for this one with a hefty grain of salt, and don’t say you weren’t warned.",2.0

""Dune"" is a franchise that demands prior knowledge of the backstory and characters from either the book series or previous adaptations to fully appreciate the intricate narrative. While the film is long and dialogue-heavy, it manages to deliver a compelling story despite the limited action sequences.

Timothée Chalamet shines in his role, though at times, his character may feel overshadowed by the ensemble cast. Florence Pugh's character, on the other hand, seems to lack a clear purpose, appearing intermittently throughout the film without a defined role.

Rebecca Ferguson delivers a standout performance as the mother figure, commanding attention whenever she appears on screen. The dynamic between Josh Brolin and Dave Bautista offers a humorous nod to their previous roles, adding an entertaining element to the movie.

Zendaya's character receives more screen time than in the previous installment, but her role remains secondary to the overarching plot. Austin Butler's portrayal, while intriguing, is hindered by sparse dialogue and an unusual vocal delivery reminiscent of an ""evil Elvis.""

As a middle installment in a trilogy, ""Dune Part 2"" serves as a foundation for character development and plot progression. While it may not be as action-packed as some viewers expect, it sets the stage for the anticipated climax in the final film of the series.

Overall, ""Dune Part 2"" is a worthwhile watch for those invested in the franchise, offering a rich and immersive cinematic experience. With the promise of a third installment on the horizon, the intricate world of ""Dune"" is poised to deliver a satisfying conclusion to the story.",8.0

1022789,Inside Out 2,"""Inside Out 2"" is a heartwarming and imaginative sequel that successfully builds on the emotional depth of its predecessor. Directed by Kelsey Mann, the film revisits Riley as she navigates the complexities of teenage life, with her emotions—Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust—returning to guide her. The movie introduces new emotions, adding fresh dynamics and challenges. The animation is vibrant and expressive, capturing the nuanced portrayal of inner emotional worlds. With its clever storytelling, humor, and poignant moments, ""Inside Out 2"" resonates deeply with audiences, offering a thoughtful exploration of growing up and emotional resilience.",8.0
1022789,Inside Out 2,"The wizards at Pixar have crafted a new gem with “Inside Out 2” which is a rare achievement in that it is a sequel that outdoes the original film.

The movie opens with Riley (Kensington Tallman), just after her 13th Birthday as Joy (Amy Poehler) recaps her accomplishments and sets the stage for her big Hockey Game with her friends Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green).

Their success on the ice attracts the attention of the coach of the local Firebirds who invites the trio to a three-day camp which will set the stage for them to be included on the team as freshmen.

Things take a turn when a Puberty alarm goes off followed by a construction crew to upgrade the console. Fear (Tony Hale), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Liza Lapira), and Sadness (Phyllis Smith),  do not react well to this and the arrival of the new emotions Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui  (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter-Hauser), sets the stage for new conflicts.

Riley arrives at camp and becomes enchanted with the popular girls who are fronted by Valentina (Lilimar), and Riley excludes her friends as a chance to be part of the in-crowd.

The new emotions set a course to keep Riley safe from her potential future issues and banish the old emotions that they view as hindering Riley and setting a path for future failure.

Forced to travel to the furthest reaches of Riley’s mind to recover something of necessity; the old emotions hope to undo the damage being done and restore Riley who is in the turmoil of being a teen and hampered by the flood of new and often conflicting emotions and circumstances that she encounters.

The movie is filled with charm and humor as well as presenting an honest look at the changes and pressures that children face during their teen years and does so without being heavy-handed. The emotions new and old are great and there are many moments throughout the film that will bring laughter as well as nostalgia for adults; especially those with children who are about to enter their Teen years.

The film is moving and there were more than a few eyes welling up near the end of the film during our screening as Pixar has once again crafted an enjoyable and relatable tale that can be enjoyed by the entire family.

1022789,Inside Out 2,"I really quite enjoyed the first of these (2015) but I struggled a bit to stay engaged with the one. ""Riley"" is still happily coasting through family life until one day, she embarks on the yellow brick road that is puberty. Towit, her control gallery is no longer the purview of just her lifelong guides like ""Fear"", ""Joy"" and ""Anger"" - now she has also to deal with the likes of disgust, envy, boredom and worst of all - anxiety. It's maybe the latter that the film should be called as we now embark on quite a humourless swipe at the culture of validation that young people must navigate. It's all about being popular. Being liked. Being the best - in the ice hockey team. Old loyalties go under the bus in favour of new aspirations and yes, much of it does ring quite true as an evaluation of the fickleness in all of us. Thing is, though, there's just too much inevitability about what comes next and there's way too much incessant dialogue. ""Anger"" has some fun along the way, and there is the odd comedy one-liner from the laconic ""Ennui"" but it just didn't resonate with me at all. The animation is standard Pixar fayre that does the job colourfully but unremarkably, and by the conclusion I was hoping there was an off button on that great big console. Yep - I'm probably too old to really appreciate this the way the kids can, but the trick for these studios has to be to engage the adults at the same time as the weans, else out come the mobile phones as our own version of ennui sets in. It's fine, but forgettable, sorry.",6.0

1022789,Inside Out 2,"Poor Pixar! They just haven't been able to catch a break this decade! Having a majority of their originals dumbed on Disney+, Lightyear flopping, and Elemental just barely managing to make a comeback after having the studio's worst opening yet. They just can't catch a break, specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore. Safe to say, they've had it rough! But Inside Out 2, despite many things working against it actually managed to be good, in fact great! Almost as good as its predecessor. I'm not gonna fully say it's a masterpiece like any of their older films, or even films like Soul or the first Inside Out, but it's still a pretty great movie! A movie that honors the original while adding to the original's themes. Instead of just being the first movie again, they actually do things a little different, by adding new emotions, covering the themes of puberty and anxiety, and adding some new locations. I also like how they don't just reset Joy back to the way she was in movie 1, they actually stick to her character development, letting the others help her, especially Sadness, and being open to new ideas. She's still flawed, of course, but it's more still growing as a character rather than just learning the same lesson again. They even subvert the originals message. Inside Out 1: it's okay to not be happy. Inside Out 2: It's okay to let happiness in. You are valued and you are good enough. There's also one scene in the movie : the panic attack. I won't spoil what happens but I really love how this scene played out. Altogether, a pretty solid film that builds on the original ti the point where I'd actually say I'd be open for a 3rd movie, something I thought I'd never, ever say ever!!! Congrats, Pix! U made a good sequel, keep it up!

           TOTAL SCORE: 8.5/10",
1022789,Inside Out 2,This movie is not bad at all. they left to open to more movies and I am good with that they kids haven’t a good franchise since toy store movies so ya I hope they keep making them!!,7.0
1022789,Inside Out 2,"When I first heard about the sequel to Inside Out, I approached it with a mix of excitement and apprehension. The original film is a masterpiece, one of Pixar’s finest achievements, seamlessly blending humor, emotion, and a profound understanding of human psychology. Given Pixar’s recent uneven track record, I feared that the sequel might not live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. However, I am delighted to report that isn't the case here.

I can confidently say that Inside Out 2 is a worthy successor to the original. It almost reaches the same level of excellence, taking the story in a fresh direction with a new cast of characters that enrich the narrative.

The sequel introduces a beautifully nuanced character: Anxiety, portrayed by Maya Hawke. Hawke’s performance brings a sympathetic depth to the role, making Anxiety a character that audiences can relate to and care for. The character adds a layer of complexity to the story that resonates on multiple levels. Anxiety's interactions with Joy, played masterfully once again by Amy Poehler, highlight the inevitable struggles of growing up. Poehler’s Joy continues to be the heart of the film.

The story’s emotional core remains as powerful as ever. As a father, the original film spoke to me deeply about understanding and acknowledging my children's emotions all by extension. This sequel shifts the focus inward, reflecting the internal emotional landscape of adolescence and early adulthood. Riley, our protagonist, is growing up, and the introduction of more complex emotions reflects the reality of her development. The film brilliantly captures the awkwardness and discomfort of this transition, making it relatable for both younger audiences and adults.

Some interactions in the film are cringe-worthy because they are so true to life. We've all experienced moments of anxiety and self-doubt, and seeing them portrayed so authentically on screen is both uncomfortable and cathartic. 

Amy Poehler's portrayal of Joy remains a highlight, and Maya Hawke’s Anxiety is a beautifully crafted antagonist who evolves throughout the film. By the end, Anxiety isn’t just a source of conflict but a character that facilitates growth and understanding. This development adds depth to the narrative, making it more than just a children’s film but a profound exploration of emotional growth.

Inside Out 2 is a summer movie that stands as a high point for family entertainment. It balances humor and emotion with a storyline that speaks to both children and adults. Pixar has once again delivered a film that not only entertains but also enlightens, reminding us of the importance of understanding and embracing all our emotions. For anyone who loved the first film, this sequel is a must-watch, capturing the same magic while exploring new emotional territory.

If you cherished the original for its insightful portrayal of emotions, you will find Inside Out 2 a worthy and enriching continuation of Riley’s journey. It’s a film that promises to be both a hit with families and a valuable conversation starter about the complex world of emotions.",8.0
1022789,Inside Out 2,"""Inside Out 2"" brilliantly follows up its predecessor with a heartwarming and deeply insightful exploration of the human mind. Directed by Pete Docter and produced by Pixar Animation Studios, this sequel delves even deeper into the complexities of emotions, creating a movie that is as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.

The film continues the story of Riley, now a teenager, navigating the tumultuous waters of adolescence. The return of our beloved emotions—Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust—offers a delightful reunion while introducing new emotional characters that reflect the evolving complexity of Riley's inner world. Each emotion is beautifully voiced, bringing authenticity and depth to their characters. Amy Poehler’s Joy and Phyllis Smith’s Sadness once again shine, their dynamic evolving in ways that are both surprising and deeply moving.",
1022789,Inside Out 2,"Inside Out 2 is a suggestion to follow Riley’s troubles during adolescence, which adds new characters to this animated movie – Anxiety and Envy, – besides Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust. Both animation and voice acting are great, and the animation properly shows the confusion and disorder of a teenage girl’s mind. Compared to ‘Toy Story 2,’ it may not be as rich in genuine sentiment, but it returns all viewers, children, and adults, to the challenge of the act of growing up.

I also enjoyed the comedy and the themes present in it and maybe because of the continuous showings or better comprehension of it allowed me to have less of a feeling compare to the first one although at some parts it is sort of teary. It was interesting to see how Joy and Anxiety interacted with each other these characters are more real in terms of showing us how emotions work during decision-making when you’re in trouble.

1184918,The Wild Robot,"There are times in our lives when nearly all of us exceed the limits of our capabilities (and often quite unexpectedly at that). But that can be a tremendous blessing, especially when we’re confronted by circumstances where such aptitudes are called for. So it is for Roz (Lupita Nyong’o), a robot who inadvertently ends up stranded on a remote island when the vessel transporting her crashes without warning. Roz isn’t alone, though; she finds herself surrounded by a diverse array of forest animals who, curious though they might be, don’t quite know what to make of the mysterious metallic stranger. Meanwhile, the somewhat bewildered new arrival is out of her anticipated element, too, expecting to be in the company of humans for whom she’s been programmed to function as a domestic servant. However, the fundamental disconnect between these parties gradually dissipates as they each get to know one another, particularly when Roz needs to grow beyond her innate programming to overcome a series of challenges and bond with her new organic familiars, most notably a young goose (Kit Connor) whom she’s charged with raising when the gosling’s parents are accidently killed. Before long, Roz develops a sentience that helps her evolve beyond a collection of circuits and microchips, a development that proves valuable in a world beset by even bigger issues. In his latest animated feature outing, writer-director Chris Sanders has created a thoughtful, entertaining tale with an uplifting message we can all draw upon when life ups the ante on us. The picture’s stunningly gorgeous animation, solid writing, and delightfully amusing voiceover performances by the likes of Nyong’o and co-stars Pedro Pascal, Bill Nighy, Mark Hamill, Catherine O’Hara, Ving Rhames and Stephanie Hsu collectively deliver a fine mix of hearty laughs, inspiring insights and touching moments, all without becoming silly or saccharine. Admittedly, the film has a little trouble finding its footing at the outset, and a few story threads feel a little underdeveloped, such as subplots related to important but underexplained environmental themes. What’s more, it can be somewhat mystifying at times trying to figure out exactly who this offering was made for, as the material often comes across as a little more mature and decidedly more intense than what one might expect for younger viewers (despite its adorable depictions of its funny, furry forest creatures). However, these modest shortcomings are more than made up for the further one gets into the story, growing progressively stronger as the narrative unfolds. Most importantly, though, it’s gratifying to see a production that genuinely rises above the low bar that has been set for many releases in this genre these days. “The Wild Robot” is one of those films that’s sure to please a wide range of moviegoers, including those who generally aren’t particularly enamored with animation. It’s a feel-good movie that doesn’t resort to wearing that trait on its sleeve – but that nevertheless achieves such an admirably heartwarming effect anyways.",7.0
1184918,The Wild Robot,"Brimming with thoughtful themes and stunning artwork, The Wild Robot is a deeply meaningful new touchstone in animated film.

Of course, animation has “heroed” nature before – see The Lion King, WALL-E and basically the entire output of Studio Ghibli. But there’s two core elements to The Wild Robot that set this film apart from the rest. The first is its gorgeous, painterly style.

The second? The film’s deeply human themes, encompassing everything from the meaning of motherhood and the lasting legacy of adoption, to our worship of technological advancement and our fraught relationship with the natural world. Like we said – The Wild Robot is nothing if not surprising.

1184918,The Wild Robot,"""Roz"" is pre-programmed to help. Whatever it is that needs doing, it is there to make it happen - even when it is wrecked on an island populated by animals whose main desire in life is to eat each other. At least the arrival of the ""monster"" manages to galvanise them into one brief moment of hostile unanimity and so when they are not trying to cannibalise it, they are shunning it's efforts to be friends. After spending a year learning their various languages, there follows a calamitous escapade with a nest, a chase with an hungry fox (""Fink"") and the creation of the most unlikely of family units charged with rearing a particularly timid little gosling whom they name ""Brightbill"". The scene is now set for some entertaining adventures as ""Roz"" has to teach her new-found charge how to eat, to swim and then ultimately to fly away so as to avoid the harsh winter. Each of those tasks comes with it's own hazards but maybe, just maybe, our little team can manage to get project ""Brightbill"" off the ground? No, of course there's no jeopardy here at all, and at times it's comes across as an amalgam of ""Wall:E"" (2008) with some Hans Christian Anderson thrown in for good measure. That's no bad thing, though, as the characterisation of the android is personable and develops amiably as his programming starts to evolve into something far more akin to a soul than a brain. It does tackle some more serious subjects - loneliness, rejection, isolation and issues with self-esteem to name a few, but always in fashion that illustrates a point then offers some sort of optimism that a solution can be found for even the most difficult challenges. The standard of animation is engagingly natural and it's genuinely quite funny with some of the observations, especially from the fox, working well within the framework of a touching story that extols the values of caring, teamwork and even a little forgiveness, without becoming gloopy or dialogue-heavy. It looks great on a big screen and is well worth a gander...!",7.0

""The Wild Robot offers much more than just immersive visuals, inspirational music, and diverse moments of pure entertainment - it's a deeply reflective story that tackles complex, relevant themes with a delicate balance of heart and humor. Through the robotic protagonist's journey of self-discovery, Chris Sanders explores the intersection of technology and nature, touching on topics like identity, empathy, and community, among others.

This thematic depth, combined with astonishing animation and an exceptional voice cast, makes Roz's adventure not only one of the most remarkable movies of the year but also an impactful study of coexistence, adaptation, and what it truly means to live in harmony with the world around us.""

1184918,The Wild Robot,"I found myself cleaning my glasses multiple times throughout the movie—not because they were dirty, but because of the overwhelming emotional impact. Truly, this film brought tears to my eyes.

Without a doubt, this is one of the finest animated movies in years. DreamWorks has delivered a masterpiece that resonates deeply. It's impossible not to empathize with the story and characters as they unfold so brilliantly on screen. Prepare yourself for an emotional journey that hits like a ton of bricks.

The attention to detail is remarkable. I was particularly impressed by the animation style, especially the distinct visual approach tailored to some characters. This creative choice truly makes them shine and adds depth to the storytelling.

That said, not every scene felt essential. A few moments seemed like unnecessary attempts to inject action into a narrative that didn't need it. These segments, while visually engaging, slightly detracted from the overall flow of an otherwise exceptional film.",9.0
1184918,The Wild Robot,"<em>'The Wild Robot'</em> is b-e-a-utiful. It all makes for a wholesome 102 minutes, which features not only an endearing story but also fair laughs and mighty heart - it hit me in the feels a fair few times. The animation is splendid, while the music and pacing are good factors too.

I did like the moments of relative darkness, in terms of a few jokes and bits that you wouldn't usually see in a flick of this type. As for the cast, Lupita Nyong'o, Pedro Pascal and Kit Connor are all ace, while the likes of Bill Nighy, Stephanie Hsu and Ving Rhames turn out to be solid supports.

There isn't much more to note, simply put: I enjoyed this. A film worthy of hype.",9.0
933260,The Substance,"The Substance delivers an intense, visually mesmerizing commentary on the entertainment industry's obsession with youth and outward beauty. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley offer remarkable, maybe even career-best performances, with Dennis Quaid excelling in his role as well. Coralie Fargeat explores how aging stars, particularly women, are discarded when they no longer meet the industry's strict beauty standards. Moore's character, haunted by the memory of her former fame and beauty, goes down a dark path in pursuit of a ""better"" version of herself. The story is also a sharp critique of power dynamics, with white men controlling who's in front of the spotlight, while women are pitted against one another for validation.

The film's production is equally impressive, especially the makeup and prosthetic work that elevates its body horror elements. While the first half of the movie is more subdued, the gore ramps up significantly as the plot unfolds, culminating in a chaotic ""fourth act"" that will leave audiences bewildered. The fast-paced editing, paired with an impactful score, heightens the tension and surrealism of the narrative. Though there's a part of me who prefers a version of the film that ends before the wild final act, the overall experience is an unforgettable, audacious exploration of vanity, control, and desperation in the entertainment world.

Rating: B+",8.0
933260,The Substance,"For a film that’s laser-focused on the human body, it’s gloriously on point that THE SUBSTANCE begins with a freshly cracked, bright yellow egg yolk. 

Eggs are the ‘giver of life’, right? They’re the origin of all of us. Gleaming and plump, the yolk suddenly gets pricked – not by a fork, but a syringe.

That’s the first juicy visual metaphor of many in this meaningfully bonkers body horror, for which French filmmaker Coralie Fargeat picked up the prestigious Best Screenplay prize at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.

To call the film ‘bold’ is a weapons-grade understatement. It’s an audacious, jaw-dropping examination of what screens & billboards demand of women (especially as they age), and how laughably impossible it is to meet those demands. Well, if you didn’t laugh, you’d cry. After watching THE SUBSTANCE, you might do both.

933260,The Substance,Demi Moore's performance in The Substance is so potent that it's hard to tell what's more intoxicating; her inevitable Best Actress win or Coralie Fargeat's razor-sharp screenplay that's already got the Oscar in the bag.,10.0
933260,The Substance,"There’s a big difference between being funny and being laughable, yet the latest from writer-director Coralie Fargeat has somehow found a way to be both. After amassing a considerable amount of largely well-earned cinematic goodwill in the film’s opening segments, the picture mercilessly squanders that support in the final act with an overlong, meandering, disgustingly gratuitous and grotesque exhibition of utterly bad taste. This story of an aging actress (Demi Moore) who seeks to revive her career by retrieving some of her lost youth with the aid of an enigmatic injectable follows her grand misadventures when the mysterious substance prompts the emergence of a younger doppelganger (Margaret Qualley), who becomes a Hollywood sex kitten sensation virtually overnight. To make this experimental venture work, however, the two individuals must follow a complex set of rules, dictates that become increasingly difficult to follow as they each vie for their respective shares of attention. And, as this scenario unfolds, tension grows between them, leading to complications and unexpected developments that become progressively harder to manage. But that’s where what works in the film ends. As the story plays out from there, it becomes stupendously absurd, and, even though there are some hearty laughs in this, there are even more ridiculously implausible and unexplained occurrences that try audience members’ patience and tolerance, so much so that I couldn’t wait for this trainwreck to end. In addition to the foregoing shortcomings, the film includes myriad changes in tone, making it difficult to determine whether this is supposed to be a serious thriller or a campy road, very much in the same way as in the incomprehensible French offering “Titane” (2021). It also shamelessly “borrows” elements from other movies in various ways, most notably imagery and narrative references from “The Shining” (1980) and “Young Frankenstein” (1974), costume designs from the “Hunger Games” franchise, and bafflingly inexplicable soundtrack excerpts from films like “Vertigo” (1958). Then there’s the picture’s obvious, heavy-handed message about the perils of misogyny, observations that, as important as they are, could easily stood to have been turned down more than a few notches (yes, we get it already). At the same time, though, there are also some fundamentally innate questions about the narrative that go wholly unanswered, leaving us with numerous head-scratching moments. Sadly, these failings detract significantly from the elements that do work (at least early on in the film), such as the fine performances of Moore and Qualley, the picture’s inventive cinematography, and a central premise that could have made for an engaging story if handled with greater finesse. But these strengths are effectively cancelled by what ultimately results when this release goes off the rails. Indeed, how “The Substance” captured the 2024 Cannes Film Festival award for best screenplay is truly mind boggling. I’m certainly a fan of the weird, wild and wacky, but this release undermines the virtues of those cherished qualities. Regrettably, I was seriously looking forward to seeing this offering, and I was decidedly impressed by what I saw in its opening acts, but that was all wiped out by how this one ultimately played out, a picture that, in the end, ironically relied more on style than “substance.”",4.0
933260,The Substance,"This takes a logical step on from Coralie Fargeat's earlier ""Reality+"" (2014) drama, only this time it takes a much more substantial swipe at all things vain. ""Elisabeth"" (Demi Moore) has been at the top of her fitness game for many a year when her boss ""Harvey"" (Dennis Quaid) decides that she's now too old and that a younger model is needed to present those programmes we all saw on the television of gorgeous, fit and healthy, people showing us how to exercise on a mat in from of our televisions each morning. Distracted by her imminent removal, she is involved in a car accident that introduces her to an handsome young nurse (Robin Grear) and then to a curious invitation to test out a mysterious fluid that can essentially give her her cake and eat it. In best ""Jekyll and Hyde"" tradition, injecting this quite literally creates a split personality. One is her current self, the other a perfect, younger specimen. They work in a rota system each gets a week of consciousness then has to take a week out. Thing is, the more vivacious character ""Sue"" (Margaret Qualley) is not so religious about sticking to these sharing rules and we quickly discover that what is ""borrowed"" can never been returned - with increasingly harrowing results. With the gushing ""Harvey"" determined to capitalise on his new ratings winner, things become decidedly irritating for the now marginalised ""Elisabeth"" - but shat can she do? There's no going back...! I think this is Moore at her best. Her palpable sense of evolving fury, exasperation and frustration is expertly captured as is the selfishness of her alter ego by an on form Qualley. Quaid steals his scenes as the truly odious epitome of corporate greed for whom it's all about the business, the money and never the actual people concerned. The denouement is reminiscent of something concocted by one of the David's - Lynch or Cronenberg, and allows the throbbing ghastliness of this story of vanity gone mad to demonstrate just how fickle life can be when there's little actual substance at all to their shallow and vacuous lives. A savage indictment of the short-term and unprincipled ""beauty"" industry that aims squarely at just about everyone and everything involved, is engagingly toxic and well worth a watch.",7.0
933260,The Substance,"Certainly an experience!

<em>'The Substance'</em> is <b>a lot</b>. It's one of those sorta movies that I needed to let settle in my mind before I even started to think about reviewing it. I'm not even sure where to start. It's insane from pretty much the beginning to the very end of its 140 minute run time, some scenes are particularly rough to watch unfold!

I think the only body horror flick I've seen up until this point is David Cronenberg's <em>'Crimes of the Future'</em> from 2022, which I found to be solid enough but it came across, at least to me, as a bit too forced for shock value. This 2024 release has plenty of that, if not more, but it somehow feels totally at home with what surrounds it.

The story itself is fascinating, even taking out all the craziness with the gore et al. So by no means is this a film that is style over substance (sorry). It isn't anything actually overly original in terms of the base plotline, though the way it is portrayed and brought to life is astounding - every inch is expertly crafted.

Demi Moore is outstanding in this! I haven't seen her in much, at least anything released post-2002, but here she is top quality throughout. Margaret Qualley is obviously the opposite in terms of the former, though is just as fantastic in regards to the latter - great performance!

If you see anyone giving warnings ahead of watching this, they are very much warranted! Even with all the graphic twistedness, which will turn many away, this is an impressively enthralling picture. I may need a lie-down though.",9.0
933260,The Substance,"I love French comedic films, and this one is no different. Coralie Fargeat crafted a seemingly simple story on the subject of Hollywood's obsession with youth and beauty, and then directed it right into the status of cult, horror, midnight, grade B (the good kind) movie genre. Brilliant!

While on the face, this movie is about aging out of Hollywood's graces, the script is also laced with interesting subplots: having a proxy that ages for you a la Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray, and the subject of shallow self-hate and self-love, along with that ""needy for applause"" character that so many actors have and must either learn to deal, or fail at life.

Demi Moore is nothing short of awesome here. Dennis Quaid and Margaret Qualley are right up there with her and Fargeat in playing over-the-top choices.",9.0
933260,The Substance,"**The Substance (2024)**
A Visceral Exploration of Youth Obsession and the Fear of Time

""The Substance"" is a bold cinematic experience that masterfully resurrects the practical effects of 1980s horror, delivering a visual and auditory feast that is both nostalgic and groundbreaking. Directed with a keen eye for detail, the film delves deep into society's obsession with youth and the inevitable passage of time, offering a thought-provoking commentary wrapped in visceral horror.
The film follows a renowned actress, portrayed by Demi Moore, who grapples with the fear of aging and losing her fame. In a desperate attempt to reclaim her youth, she becomes entangled with a mysterious substance that promises vitality but comes with horrifying consequences. As she navigates this treacherous path, the lines between reality and obsession blur, leading to a descent into madness.
At its core, ""The Substance"" is a critique of the 21st-century fixation on youth over the value of life experience. It echoes themes from classics like ""Death Becomes Her"" and ""The Picture of Dorian Gray,"" highlighting the shame associated with aging and the societal pressure to maintain perpetual youthfulness. The film questions whether society promotes a 'sexy reality' at the expense of genuine substance and wisdom.
The narrative explores the concept of cheating death, not just literally but metaphorically, as a fear of social death—being forgotten or replaced. This is poignantly portrayed through Moore's character, who embodies the desperation of clinging to relevance in a world that idolizes the new and discards the old.

From the opening scenes, it's evident that the physical effects are a labor of love—a homage to the era before CGI dominated horror. The gore is unapologetically front and center, reminiscent of Cronenberg's ""The Fly,"" pushing the boundaries of on-screen grotesque. The disturbingly realistic blood effects, combined with meticulously crafted sound design, amplify the discomfort, making the audience squirm.

**Color Palette and Visual Aesthetics**
The color palette is meticulously crafted, bathing scenes in hues that evoke unease and familiarity simultaneously. The use of shadows and lighting enhances the suspense, while the wardrobe and costume design serve as narrative devices, illustrating the juxtaposition between youth and age, purity and corruption.

**Performances**
Demi Moore delivers a stellar performance, capturing the vulnerability and desperation of a woman battling the relentless march of time. Her portrayal adds depth to the film's themes, embodying the internal decay and obsession manifesting physically through the substance. The supporting cast also contributes significantly, with each character representing different facets of society's views on youth and aging.

**Critique**
While the film excels in many areas, it isn't without flaws. The ending feels abrupt, leaving several narrative threads untied, which may leave some viewers unsatisfied. Additionally, the persistent focus on teen emotional states can be grating, potentially alienating those seeking a more mature exploration of the presented themes.

**Engaging with the Hype**
""The Substance"" has generated significant buzz online, sparking discussions about its innovative use of practical effects and its deep societal commentary. The hype seems to stem from both horror enthusiasts who appreciate the throwback to classic techniques and audiences resonating with its timely themes. However, it's worth considering whether the film is merely feeding into the very cycle of superficiality it aims to criticize.


""The Substance"" is a visceral commentary on the fear of aging, the obsession with youth, and the inevitable march of time. It challenges viewers to reflect on their perceptions of age, experience, and what truly holds value. By drawing parallels with films like ""Gremlins,"" ""Frankenstein,"" ""A Christmas Carol,"" and ""Carrie,"" it positions itself as a modern amalgamation of timeless themes.
Despite its imperfections, the film succeeds in sparking conversation—a hallmark of impactful cinema. It's as uncomfortable as it is thought-provoking, demanding to be felt and discussed. Whether you love it or hate it, ""The Substance"" is a noteworthy addition to the horror genre that holds up a mirror to society's own fears and obsessions.

**Extra Thoughts**
- The film raises pertinent questions about our role in perpetuating the fear of aging. Are we complicit in creating a world where experience is devalued?
- The character dynamics suggest that embracing change and maintaining balance might be key to a fulfilling life, even if it comes at a cost.
- The hype surrounding the movie could reflect its resonance with audiences grappling with similar fears and obsessions in today's youth-centric culture.

**Final Recommendation**
""The Substance"" may not offer all the answers, but it provides a platform for dialogue on important societal issues. Its blend of classic horror techniques with contemporary themes makes it a film worth experiencing. If you're a fan of thought-provoking horror that goes beyond mere scares, this movie deserves a place on your watchlist.",9.0
933260,The Substance,"""The Substance"" is something of a cinematic mash up. 

First off, this story is somewhat  reminiscent of ""Death Becomes Her"". The 1992 film starring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis. 

The notion of the fatal conceit in the search for eternal youth amongst the ageing Hollywood set is very much central to the story in both films.

That said, the handling is distinctly different. This film is a lot louder, gaudier, brasher, cruder and ruder, than its 90's counterpart by a country mile. There are elements I'd typically associate with Lovecraft too, that are grotesque, monstrous and disturbing. 

This work is also more a visually clever, as opposed to a compelling narrative based experience. Its messages are conveyed, like Hollywood itself, through larger than life youthful glitz and glamour but also an innate, ephemeral shallowness.A shallowness that becomes a kind of obsessive prison, denying those trapped in it, any meaningful form of human intimacy.

My only criticism of what I do feel is a very good film, is it overplays its hand. Its so over the top in the latter part of the film, I felt it partly drowned out the message, it had, up to that point, convincingly conveyed. The closing scenes. in particular, felt crude, clumsy and would have worked considerably better, with more controlled and subtle, handling. 

In summary, ""The Substance"" is a rather clever film that uses the eye of the lens to expose how what we see, in Hollywood at least, is more important than who we are. People are shiny commodities to be replaced when the beautiful image they portray starts to wither away. As we see, youth and beauty is everything, no matter the price. 

I will say too, this is by no means a perfect cinematic experience. It can be over the top, especially in the latter part of the film. That said, there is, on balance, more to like here than not. Definitely worth a look.",7.0
933260,The Substance,"A disaster. It's an insult to the illustrious careers of Demi Moore and Dennis Quaid, who both deserve far better.

The film focuses too heavily on the body of Margaret Qualley's character, Sue, at the expense of delivering a meaningful story or message. The gratuitous gore towards the end seems to be an attempt to align with current trends, but it falls flat.

Ultimately, Coralie Fargeat failed to deliver a coherent message, making the movie a missed opportunity for everyone involved.",2.0

However, while it’s bold and at times deeply unsettling, it doesn’t quite achieve that elusive ""perfectly balanced (as all things should be, cit.)"" quality.
The narrative occasionally stumbles, with gaps that detract from its overall impact.
It’s thought-provoking but not groundbreaking — a film that’s above average, yet just shy of excellence.

And I like to imagine that the director somehow died during the making of the movie and was secretly replaced by Yoshihiro Nishimura.",

""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga deepens its titular protagonist and the respective post-apocalyptic world, offering a captivating origin story that enriches Fury Road, but its excessive runtime, predictability, and time spent addressing the other installment's flaws hinder its enjoyment.

The action set pieces lack the same novelty factor and frenetic pace, but the stunts remain impressive. The performances of Anya Taylor-Joy and Alyla Browne as Furiosa deserve praise, as does Chris Hemsworth's insane portrayal of Dementus.

Rating: B+",7.0
786892,Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"The young ""Furiosa"" (Alyla Browne) is captured by some rogue bikers and despite the best efforts of her sharp-shooting mother is help captive by the menacing ""Dementus"" (Chris Hemsworth) who rather paternally calls her ""Little D""! This dystopian world really consists of three powers. The ""Immortan Joe"" (Lachy Hulme) in an unassailable citadel where food and water are plentiful, the ""Guardian of Gastown"" (Peter Stephens) who runs the last refinery producing petrol and the ""Bullet Farm"" - a quarry. They have a loose bartering arrangement that allows each to hold their own territory and this is arrangement ""Dementus"" and his army of thousands wants to take control of. He does manage to secure a better deal with ""Joe"" but only if he trades his ""Little D"" as part of the bargain. Once she's been duly swapped and introduced to his harem, she determines that she needs a new ID! Years go by as she passes for a boy, moves up the food chain at the Citadel and is finally sent on war-rig duties trading gas for food. It's now that she (Anya Taylor-Joy) encounters the war-rig driver ""Praeteorian Jack"" (Tom Burke) and, thinking he might be a conduit for her to get back home, joins forces for some battles royal. As origin stories go, this is good end to end stuff, quickly paced and packed with action right from the beginning. Hemsworth is highly entertaining as the prose-spouting monster and there are loads of supporting characters - the likes of ""Smeg"", ""Rictus Erectus"" and ""Scrotus"" to characterise these gangs of violent and ruthless half-wits. ATJ doesn't really have that much to do for most of this, and has virtually no dialogue - but when she is on screen she works well with her ninja skills coming to the fore. I didn't love the ending, it drags a bit and is entirely predictable, but this holds up well for 2½ hours and the stunt work and live-action photography is impressive.",7.0
786892,Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"Whilst Furiosa isn't a bad action film, I suspect its lacklustre response from audiences, reflects not whats on offer but whats absent. 

On the upside is loads of heart stopping action, amazing cinematic's, great sets, plus strong performances from the cast.

A lesser aspect of the downside is the unnecessarily drawn out back story, replete with details about the key character, no one cares about, which, in turn, leads to the main fault in this film.......ITS NOT ABOUT MAD MAX Rockatansky.

Lets be honest, no one's really interested in peripheral characters or their back story, they want the REAL DEAL. That's where this film was always going to fall flat with viewing audiences.

If this film had been about Mad Max with a back story covering as yet unrevealed aspects of the life of  the younger and older Max, in the latter case played by the actor who made the franchise famous, Mel Gibson, then I suspect Hollywood would have a real HIT on their hands. 

In summary, you don't make a major film about the back story of a peripheral character from a franchise, you make the film about the MAIN character, its as simple as that. I'm amazed this wasn't obvious.",6.0
786892,Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"I enjoyed <em>'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga'</em>, which is a rightful addition to the <em>'Mad Max'</em> franchise.

I personally would say that the run time is way too long, like this does not need to be a 2hr 20min+ movie. With that said, I still got the desired amount of entertainment from this 2024 flick. Chris Hemsworth is outstanding, easily the most I've wanted to see a character onscreen from this series; he fits the role perfectly.

Anya Taylor-Joy puts in a very good showing as well, her character doesn't say much so a lot of the performance is reliant on her visual emotions - which Taylor-Joy portrays on point. The rest of the cast are on the same level to me, all support the show well without rising near the lead two; similar-ish story for the whole franchise, in truth.

Visually the movie looks cracking, while the action matches prior installments in providing the vast majority of what makes these films so worth the watch. This prequel/spin-off is one I'd put in the top bracket from this series, it's up there with <em>'Mad Max: Fury Road'</em> - which does just slightly edge ahead.",8.0
786892,Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"I really enjoyed this film! It is _a lot_ of explosions and brutality, but it was continually compelling — even as I questioned why I was so invested. At 2h20m it definitely made me feel my sleepy age (I saw it on my 39th birthday, and I was squinting and yawning by the end!) but I felt more impressed that a relatively slow paced film gripped me for so long.

It's a proper odyssey, with poor Furiosa only wanting to get home; but the trials she faces grow organically out of the plot and the universe, and give Furiosa a depth I didn't expect from a character/actor who's almost entirely expressionless through the film.

This entry in the Mad Max continuum (though I've only watched [the first](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/9659-mad-max), and [Fury Road](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/76341-mad-max-fury-road)) steers away from exploring the whats and whys of the apocalyptic world they live in, tempting though I'm sure it was in a 2024 that has _so many_ parallels, and instead lets us draw our own conclusions. The men in power who lie and rabble-rouse to get the power they desire, just so they can watch the world burn (again); how much we all embrace making ourselves vulnerable for the hope of human connection; the power dynamics and game theory in a world where two thirds of what you need is only necessary because of collective attitudes.

I'm certain I'll watch this again—and as a stand-alone film—which, for a long and relatively simple plot, is something very uncommon for me. I hope you enjoy it too!

786892,Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"Yeah, Furiosa. What a furious young lady. Thor does a good job. Well executed lore and world building. Sure does suck to be a lady in this wasteland. Fun to see education breakdown. Didn't even mind the runtime so maybe it should be a 10.",8.0
786892,Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"This installment of the Mad Max saga was disappointing. Personally, I would have preferred a continuation of Furiosa's story with Charlize Theron rather than an origin story. However, once Anya Taylor-Joy was cast, my excitement returned. Her performance in The Menu is one of my favorites, and she has never given a bad performance. Despite my anticipation, I walked out of this movie feeling underwhelmed.

The film feels a bit detached from the franchise. Returning to an origin story, especially in this series, feels like a misstep. The strength of the first four movies lies in their forward momentum and the development of their characters. We've already seen the beginning in Mad Max; what the audience craves is progress, ideally with Max at the forefront but I would like to see 'Furiosa' along for future rides.

While the cinematography is undeniably gorgeous, the editing leaves much to be desired. The film spends too much time on areas that don't align with what makes a Mad Max film great. For example, the original films excelled in their high-octane action sequences and tight pacing, whereas this installment meanders, losing the kinetic energy that defines the series and limits an entire war to a montage.

Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of Dementus is a mixed bag. He brings a certain fun to the role, but his character often feels frustratingly inconsistent. There are moments where Dementus' choices seem out of character or simply don’t make sense, disrupting the narrative flow and diminishing the overall impact of the film. Some could argue that his demented nature is the reason for his decisions but even that idea falls flat.

One of the most disappointing aspects is that this movie lacks the fun, rewatchable quality of its predecessors. The previous films in the series are known for their relentless pace and compelling characters, making them enjoyable to revisit. This installment, however, doesn’t capture that same magic, leaving it feeling somewhat deflated in comparison.

While 'Furiosa' offers some stunning visals and strong performances, it ultimately fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessors. The decision to focus on an origin story rather than continuing Furiosa's journey feels like a missed opportunity. Fans of the franchise may find some enjoyment in the film, but it doesn’t possess the same exhilarating spirit that made the earlier movies iconic.

Moving forward, it would be more satisfying to see the series return to its roots, focusing on character-driven narratives that push the story forward. A continuation of Furiosa’s journey or a new chapter with Max would likely resonate more with audiences, capturing the essence of what makes Mad Max an enduring and beloved franchise.",5.0
786892,Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"**Wonder Woman **

Lately, it seems Hollywood has been casting great actresses in strong female roles but pairing them with subpar writing. This movie is not one of those. I went in with the mindset of ""here we go again,"" but came out surprisingly satisfied. The story, acting, and action are all top-notch, and it seamlessly leads into ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" without missing a beat. Don't skip this one—it's probably the best in the franchise.",
786892,Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"There’s no doubt that “Furiosa” is a strong, entertaining, and high quality film, but director George Miller‘s latest installment in the Mad Max franchise falls short in delivering the same fresh and original experience as “Fury Road.” Miller builds on the legacy of the 2015 Oscar-winning hit, but the film still struggles with a repetitive narrative (and a tired retread of visuals) that fails to capture the groundbreaking innovations that made its predecessor such a worldwide phenomenon. I liked this movie a lot, but I certainly didn’t love it.

As the world collapses, young Furiosa (Alyla Browne) is forcibly taken from the Green Place of Many Mothers and captured by a formidable Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth). As they traverse the Wasteland, they encounter the Citadel, ruled by Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme). Amidst the power struggle between these two tyrants, Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy) must endure numerous trials to gather the resources needed to find her way back home.

The film tells the origin story of the renegade warrior (and certified badass) Furiosa before her encounter with Mad Max. It’s a prequel to “Fury Road,” and this movie builds a satisfying history to the unlikely female hero. The first half of the story is the most compelling, as the narrative traces Furiosa’s journey from a young girl held captive in a brutal world to her development into a fierce combatant. The first part of her history is also filled with the most emotional depth, outlining the motivations of her character and the harsh realities that shaped her. It adds layers of complexity to the character, which is why I found this part of the movie to be the most engaging.

The second half began to wear me down as it falls into a repetitive cycle of desert chases and action scenes that feel all too familiar. While they’re executed with Miller’s signature flair, they seem lacking in innovation. The whole “been there, done that” vibe really puts a damper on things. I think part of the problem here is that “Fury Road” set such a high bar with its inventive visual style and storytelling, and a lot of that is replicated (flaming fireballs, armored trucks, vast expanses of golden deserts…even some of the exact same stunts are in play). This makes the film too predictable and slightly disappointing, especially when that element of surprise and eye-popping awe has come to define the franchise. The action is a blast and the post-apocalyptic setting and costumes are exceptional, but the envelope isn’t quite pushed as far as it could’ve been.

The brightest spot is, without question, Simon Duggan‘s cinematography. This is a gorgeous looking movie from beginning to end, and the visuals capture the brutality as well as the stark beauty of the wasteland. The special effects are also flawless, but all of these technical achievements (and strong performances from the cast) can’t quite compensate for the weaker elements — although I would venture to guess that diehard fans aren’t going to care.

“Furiosa” is a worthy addition to the Mad Max saga, even if it doesn’t reach the creative heights nor deliver the groundbreaking experience that delighted all of us with “Fury Road.”

786892,Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"Some decent action sequences as expected though, from my memory, doesn't come close to the epic chaos from Fury Road. The acting for the most part was fine and Chris Hemsworth seemed to be having some fun in his villain role while Anya Taylor-Joy was fine as Furiosa. However, having this coming out 9 years after Fury Road and a spin-off of a character that frankly I had little interest in, was the downfall of this prequel. Beyond that, the plot itself wasn't enthralling and at times I was pretty bored.

I wish we got an actual Mad Max: Fury Road sequel with Tom Hardy; why they went this route is puzzling, but not to mention taking so long to get it out. It's not too surprising this bombed at the box office and was the death nail of the franchise. **2.75/5**",6.0
786892,Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"George Miller definitely had it him to make it epic.

I hadn't seen Fury Road since it came out, so I took the liberty to watch it and finish it an hour before I went to go see Furiosa, and personally, I liked Furiosa more. 

The antagonist felt a lot more connected to the plot and the world building was better, you were able to get more of a scope of the world. 

Anya Taylor-Joy is one of my favorite actresses, everything she's in is good and this is no exception. 

The cinematography of this movie was also more creative.

The only drawback for me was that the vehicle designs did not seem as special as Fury Road's. They just seemed like the basic motorcycles and 18 wheelers, which isn't that bad, it's just a little sad.

Overall a great watch, better than any of the fast and furious movies for sure.

I had heard rumblings about it being bad but, again too me, that is just not true. It is also claimed that it didn’t do as well as expected at the box office but then this is oftentimes clueless Hollywood bean counters with unrealistic and overinflated expectations causing this.

This is the kind of action filled, crazy and fairly violent movie that you would expect from a Mad Max movie.

The action is good, the characters are good, the settings are good (the Bullet Farm was mostly a whole in the ground and a bit underwhelming though), and the story is actually not bad at all.

Also, there is no woke, far left preaching that I could notice in the movie which in todays world is a great plus.

Overall I really liked the movie and its two and a half hour run length did not really feel too long.

If I should complain about something it would be that they just skipped over the war between Dementus and Immortan Joe with some bla bla about humans always having fought wars.

The movie also felt a bit “sanitized”, that is lacking grittiness and gore, for being a Mad Max movie. The R rating that it apparently got in the US is pretty ridiculous. In France it got a 13+ rating.

786892,Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,"""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is enjoyable enough and George Miller is an amazing director, but the film is overlong and it does have a tendency to meander too much of the time. It is basically nothing more than a high octane succession of action scenes at its core, but don't get yourself too excited by the prospect of this. The scenes in question lack the raw excitement of the original trilogy and this is principally because most of the action is obviously taking place in the comfortable security of the studio. This is disappointing, especially when compared to the downright reckless derring-do of the original films where the absolutely superb stunt teams risked life and limb in pursuit of the imaginative and timeless sequences they captured on film for our enjoyment back in the hazardous days where health and safety precautions barely existed at all whereas today the most serious injury you are apt to receive is when your harness suddenly goes a little crazy and bounces you off the nearest green screen.",6.0

""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is a “more” version of the previous installment. More Hollow Earth, more Titans, more gloriously giant fights filled with fantastic visual effects… and much more nonsense too.

Through an openly absurd narrative, Adam Wingard takes the charm and chemistry of his cast to help focus the film’s main spotlight on the titanic protagonists, Godzilla and Kong, delivering two hours of pure, unadulterated entertainment.

823464,Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"It has to get at least three stars because it's got Dan Stevens (and his piercing eyes) in it. Otherwise, this is an entirely derivative and predictable effort that leaves nothing at all to our imagination. A truce has broken out since the last time (2021), with ""Kong"" ruling the roost deep in ""Hollow Earth""; ""Godzilla"" curled up asleep in the Coliseum and ""Ilene"" (Rebecca Hall) and the troubled ""Jia"" (Kaylee Hottle) keeping an eye on things for ""Monarch"" and mankind. ""Kong"" has a bad tooth so he comes to the humans for help. Fortunately, ""Trapper"" (the aforementioned DS) is a dab hand at grand-scale dentistry but it's while the ape is topside that alarm bells go off. ""Godzilla"" starts marauding again and an undiscovered vortex in the nether world requires investigation by ""Kong"" and his human pals. With ""Bernie"" (Brian Tyree Henry) back in the gang, off they all go to discover that a new menace has arrived, destroyed their monitoring outpost and it is now setting up a battle royal with just about every Titan left on Earth - above or below. Adam Winyard does just about everything on this film, and that shows in a complete lack of objectivity when evaluating this third rate adventure, the banal writing and equally lacklustre acting. It's as plain as the nose on your face why ""Godzilla' - who doesn't feature so much in this - is collecting energy, and when we do eventually get to them, the combat scenes are repetitive and too tightly choreographed. The scale is all over the place too. At times ""Kong"" appears the size of an house, at others he's more like a mouse. The visual effects are put to good use, but Hall just underwhelms, Henry talks way too much and Stevens' busky humour just doesn't hit home at all. I know it's difficult to keep coming up with new ideas for this genre and it must be difficult for the actors to constantly engage with nothing but some greenscreen, but the story is thin and the film reminds you of just about everything from ""Jurassic Park"" to episodes of ""Stargate"". It does need a big screen, though. On television it will be even more forgettable - but I did like the moth.",6.0
823464,Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"A whole load of nothing!

<em>'Godzilla × Kong: The New Empire'</em> is not a good movie, in my opinion anyway. It is similar to its predecessor in that sense at least, this is a minute improvement on that 2021 entry mind. It's basically a Kong film though, Godzilla goes missing for large periods. There is less human to be found onscreen which is good to see, but what's added in its place with Kong is just so dull to me.

The needless humanising of Kong continues, though this time it's actually done in and around the other monsters because... well, actually I'm not sure why monsters are acting human-like to each other but, eh, the movie, I guess. That Suko young ape character is particularly annoying too, it sounded like a clown horn and looks more belonging to that one Coldplay music video.

The whole film feels like if <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/films/in/avatar-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/"" rel=""nofollow"">Avatar</a>'</em> and the <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/films/in/planet-of-the-apes-reboot-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/"" rel=""nofollow"">Planet of the Apes</a>'</em> reboots had a baby and that's not a positive. It felt watching that it was also taking bits and pieces from other films too, mind perhaps that's just me reaching? The best scene of it all features the two titular characters in Giza, their bits together in Hollow Earth are decent too but their opponents are incredibly lame.

Cast-wise, it's OK. Rebecca Hall and Kaylee Hottle are as fine as previously, Brian Tyree Henry is marginally improved and Dan Stevens is serviceable. None of the others are all that noteworthy to me, but that actually is a true plus for this production; last time out I wanted less humans and less humans is what we get here.

My review kinda reads as if I hate this 2024 release. I do not, there are far worse pictures out there of course. It's just a heap of disappointment. I guess I just want pure, turn-off-your-brain titan carnage from these flicks, which evidently is not what the Monsterverse is necessarily trying to do... that's probably on me.

For the main human characters here, this only ever gets engaging at the very end.

I'm beginning to think the problem here is that movies like this are no longer ""movies"", they're ""installments"". They don't feel like self-contained polished products anymore, they feel like filler episodes filled with smaller barely connected filler episodes. Godzilla x Kong is like the opening to Age of Ultron, except it's the majority of the movie. You just don't really feel grounded at all.

There's too much music. They try to recapture the ""magic"" of the intro and ending of Godzilla vs Kong but it fails spectacularly. It was cute there because the focus was on Kong and they didn't overdo it. Here the focus is on Trapper AKA NOT Kong AKA no one cares about Trapper because not giving the man a name is doing a stupid.

The monster action is fine. Kong meeting the other Great Apes got me pumped and the finale is lackluster but satisfying enough.

So, Season 2 of Monarch when?",6.0
823464,Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"The mistake I made was watching Godzilla Minus One first. I don't know if the screenwriters' strike disrupted Godzilla X Kong, but the story seems to come straight from the book ""How to Write a Hollywood Screenplay."" The music feels like it came from a documentary about African great apes. The opening narration is unnecessary. The characters are typical Hollywood stereotypes seen in hundreds of films. As for the special effects, there's nothing to criticize; they are what save the film.",6.0
823464,Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"Not great but ultimately satisfying, if not mindless, sci-fi actioner and addition to the Monsterverse. There was never a moment I was bored so that has a one-up over the previous film, Godzilla vs. Kong, and they kept the human actors to a minimum with only four characters taking focus. The visual effects were passable enough and I did like the continued characterization given to Kong and to some extent, Godzilla. In the end, it's an entertaining time-waster and doesn't overstay its welcome showing you these movies can be under two hours. **3.25/5**",7.0
823464,Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"This is the weakest of the of the ""Monsterverse"" series of films to this point. The CGI is all-out cartoonish, and it makes it nearly impossible to care about what's going on. Nothing looks real and I'm sure the creators of these movies have given up trying to make anything photo realistic. Or maybe it's an intentional choice because moviegoers actually prefer it to be unrealistic. Perhaps CGI has morphed into its own thing and realism is no longer required. That's probably the case and what a sad evolution that is.

The final battle in Rio is so chaotic that even though buildings are being smashed by monster fighting, none of it has any weight, structurally or consequentially. The scale of the monsters on the surface is diminished by the lack of anything to judge their size by when they are in ""Hollow Earth"". It's a lot like the old **Godzilla vs. Megalon** film released back in 1973. Godzilla and Jet Jaguar battle Gigan and Megalon and the whole thing takes place in an open field. The size of the kaiju is completely lost by having the fight take place in this setting. Hollow Earth promotes the same kind of scale problems. It's also a mistake to make these huge beasts move with the agility they do in this movie.

The Hollow Earth concept is lame and seems like it's a way to allow for Kong to still be the king of something since Godzilla is the dominant Titan on the planet. The humans in this movie are disposable again and this is even more evident when comparing this film to the far superior **Godzilla Minus One**, not to mention the stakes raised in **Shin Godzilla**.

The lack of dialogue, either by an important cast member being deaf or due to a lot of monsters growling and grunting, probably allows the Monsterverse movies to sell well internationally. The necessity for dubs and subtitles is greatly reduced. _""You mean I don't have to read!?! Awesome!!!""_

It actually pains me to have to write an almost entirely negative review. As a reference, I own EVERY Godzilla movie on physical media and consider it to be my favorite film series. Many, many of them are silly B-movies and some of them I don't even like, but none of them seem as formulaic or as tossed off as **Godzilla X Kong**.",4.0
823464,Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"The Monsterverse is headed in a fun direction with its 'Titans', more famously known as Godzilla and Kong. However, while the action and spectacle continue to impress, the human element of these movies has significantly declined with this latest installment.

My hope is that the great character-building seen in the Monarch series can catch up to the movies. The human characters in this movie feel underdeveloped and somewhat sidelined, which detracts from the overall narrative. 

Despite these shortcomings, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is an action-packed and fun addition to the Kaiju subgenre. The introduction of new Titans, Skar and Shimo, provides a fresh and exciting rivalry for our iconic heroes. Their dynamic interactions and epic battles are thrilling to watch. 

Adam Wingard's direction effectively channels the spirit of the Showa Era Godzilla films, blending it with an 80s aesthetic and a futuristic vibe. This stylistic choice creates a unique and visually appealing backdrop for the film. 

The film also explores themes of rivalry, survival, and the balance of power, although these are primarily conveyed through the Titans' interactions rather than the human characters. The tone is a mix of nostalgic homage and modern spectacle, aiming to please long-time fans and newcomers alike. For example, scenes where Godzilla and Kong reluctantly team up against a common foe evoke a sense of epic camaraderie and respect, reminiscent of classic monster team-ups.

Overall, while Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire excels in delivering thrilling action and visual spectacle, it falls short in human character development. The new Titans, Skar and Shimo, are exciting additions that enrich the kaiju universe. Adam Wingard's direction brings a nostalgic yet fresh aesthetic to the film. If future installments can balance the monster action with stronger human elements, the Monsterverse will continue to be a captivating franchise. This movie is a must-watch for fans of the genre, promising an entertaining and visually stunning experience.",6.0

Since ""Avatar,"" I find myself comparing every movie with heavy CGI to it.This almost looks like a video game in comparison.  However, I will give this film points for its music; the soundtrack was decent and helped move the scenes along. I'm not particularly fond of the Godzilla franchise as a whole. Perhaps it's because I was too young to appreciate the originals and now need more depth from the newer ones.

It is a simple huge monster bash feast plain and simple. It is a movie ment to entertain and nothing else. There was next to none woke. far-left preaching and the little messaging there was was more of the governments are really stupid kind.

There is actually a story in this movie and it is not bad. Sure, it is on the low IQ part of the spectrum but it is on the mid to higher end of what you would expect from this kind of movie.

Of course this is a movie driven by its special effects and I cannot say that I was disappointed. The scenery is oftentimes quite beautiful and the action whether it takes place on the surface, with the property destruction one would expect from a Godzilla & Kong movie, or down in hollow earth is very good.

I saw some people complaining that the CGI was poor. I don’t know which movie they watched but it was not this one.

823464,Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire"" features the sort of threat to humanity which makes these films so fantastic. The threat on this occasion, at least in part, deals with the Skar King and his desperate bid to conquer the surface of the earth. He led his tribe into war against Godzilla once before, we are told, but they were defeated and now the Skar King is making yet another bid to reach the surface. The way all the parts of this story are gradually disclosed in a piecemeal fashion as the film unfolds leaves a good quota of mystery and intrigue for us to puzzle over and savour. The poignantly bitter sweet yet heart warming spine of the whole film concerns the idea that Jia and Kong are the last of their tribes and this is well expanded upon and it all works terrifically well like the rest of it to produce a popcorn movie of truly epic proportions which is great fun to watch.",8.0
823464,Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,"This installment pits Godzilla and Kong against each other once again, only for them to realize they must unite against a greater threat to protect Hollow Earth. Like previous films in the franchise, it’s an undeniably fun ride—embracing its absurdity with a story so ridiculous you can’t help but enjoy it. There’s a strange intelligence in how it commits to its own nonsense, making the over-the-top spectacle work.

That said, why even include humans? The movie barely cares about them. Monsters rampage through Egypt, Brazil, and beyond, leaving destruction in their wake without consequence. Yes, it’s a monster movie, but the sheer disregard for human stakes borders on comical. Still, the simplicity works—this is pure, mythical creature combat at its finest.

Where the film truly excels is in its direction. The visuals, creature designs, and non-verbal storytelling elevate it beyond its predecessors. The director masterfully conveys emotion and narrative without heavy dialogue, making the monster interactions surprisingly compelling. The Hollow Earth concept is pure fantasy, but that’s part of the charm—it’s so far removed from reality that your brain just goes along for the ride.

Fans of Fast & Furious might understand the appeal: it’s big, dumb fun that thrives on spectacle. But Godzilla x Kong earns its absurdity more convincingly, thanks to its fantastical world. The Zack Snyder influence is clear, particularly in the epic, Justice League-esque visuals—though that’s not a bad thing.

Will this movie change your life? No. But if you’re here for jaw-dropping monster battles and stunning direction, it’s a wildly entertaining escape.",7.0
945961,Alien: Romulus,"<em>'Alien: Romulus'</em> is actually very good.

Of the more modern day releases from this franchise, this is the one I've enjoyed the most. When I was immediately coming out of the cinema I was just plainly thinking of it as being solidly good, however the more I think about it the more I had fun with this seventh installment.

The plot, or at least the set-up to it, is quite uncreative, as in I feel like so many films - from this series included - have a crew make-up of similar people and similar characteristics/motivations; <em>'Crater'</em> and <em>'I.S.S.'</em> (both very good, don't get me wrong) are recent examples that spring to mind. Happily, though, the rest of the flick makes up for any weakness in that area.

Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson are the great performers in this, I found them both to be excellent throughout. Two actors I want to see much more of, having already seen them in a few pleasing pictures; e.g. <em>'Civil War'</em> and <em>'Rye Lane'</em>.

I also liked the sound design and even the jump scares, which I'm not usually a fan of (bit lazy etc.) but there is enough about how they do them here that it works. Those facehuggers remain brilliantly effective, though the xenomorph isn't amazingly utilised - the human version didn't hit for me, felt <em>'I Am Legend'</em>-esque.

All in all, it's up there as one of my favourites from the franchise. For me, <em>'Alien'</em> and <em>'Aliens'</em> just narrowly better this, though it's a marginal improvement on (the entertaining) <em>'Alien Resurrection'</em> and it surpasses every other release, in my eyes.",8.0
945961,Alien: Romulus,"I gather director Fede Alvarez made a conscious - and probably expensive - decision to keep the use of CGI to a minimum here and it really does work. ""Rain"" (Cailee Spaeny) and her ""brother"" are looking to get off-planet but she can't get travel papers from the all-powerful mining company. Desperate, she and ""Andy"" (David Jonsson) are offered a chance by wide boys ""Tyler"" (Archie Renaux) and ""Bjorn"" (Spike Fearn) to raid a decrepit old spacecraft that appears to be in a decaying orbit, so they can pinch it's cryogenic pods and enable them all to escape to another planet out of reach of their enthralling taskmasters. Off they set onto the ""Romulus"" and that's where, well you just know what's going to happen now, as they inadvertently turn the central heating on and find themselves in mortal danger. ""Andy"" just happens to be a synthetic, which proves especially useful when they discover the remains of ""Rook"" (the spitting image of the late Sir Ian Holm) but is this oozing mess of gunge and wiring actually an help or an hindrance? Getting off is going to be a lot harder than getting on! To be honest, the acting here is really neither here nor there. Renaux and Isabella Merced - their cohort ""Kay"" do enough, Fearn rather over-plays his chip-on-the-shoulder character and there's a slightly soporific effort from Jonsson, but that's not what I was watching for. This is all about the best monsters sci-fi cinema has ever created, and right from their first appearance I was in their corner. There's loads of darkly shot menace crammed into the two hours with plenty of references to it's originator and even more insinuations about the greed of a ""company"" that doesn't know when to leave well alone. Just like the other ""Alien"" films, it takes a Russian Doll approach to the ending, so don't think we're going to get off with just the one, definitive, ""get away from her..."" moment, and of course the lift plays a pivotal part in the proceedings as acid blood drips everywhere. It's not so good as the first two Sigourney Weaver outings, but slips neatly into bronze medal position for me in a series that can still prove quite compellingly scary. It's a cinema must - telly just won't do the lighting and photography justice at all.",7.0
945961,Alien: Romulus,"Whilst not as awful as the Aliens franchise films that came after the excellent first and second films, starring Sigourney Weaver, Alien Romulus is not without its shortcomings. 

Whats immediately noticeable, in spite of the rugged, industrial setting, is a cast that look like they just escaped from the set of Beverly Hills 90210. Youthful, fresh faced, physically unimposing, with not a grease stain or blemish in sight, they feel badly out of place. 

If you can put the sense of disbelief regarding the casting aside (I couldn't) the actual story fares only marginally better. It feels like a borrowed affair, where its taken aspects of the first two successful films and tried to craft a newer iteration.

The results an alright, if at times, somewhat ridiculous story, punctuated by moments of compelling action. That said, haven't we seen it all before, in one form or another? 

In summary, miscasting combined with a story that blandly apes superior earlier films, leads to an ""okay"" watch that's fails to distinguish itself.If you are new to this franchise, my advice start with Alien from 1979 and then its plural successor Aliens, instead.",6.0
945961,Alien: Romulus,"Color me thoroughly surprised at how much I was delighted by “Alien: Romulus,” a highly creative, beautifully executed, pulse-pounding science fiction film from director Fede Alvarez. This sequel is a rare gem in the world of big budget franchise flicks because it not only respects its predecessors with thoughtfully well done homages, but also pushes the boundaries of the universe it inhabits with inventive set pieces and a plausible story. Fans of the series and the genre are in for a real treat.

Going back to the roots of the “Alien” franchise, the film tells the story of a group of young space colonizers (Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Aileen Wu, and Spike Fearn)who are looking for a way out of their current situation as hard laborers on a sunless planet. While searching the universe, they encounter a decommissioned ship that has enough supplies to take them far, far away. Intent on scavenging, the group makes a risky voyage into space where they get far more than they bargained for: a face-to-face encounter with a terrifying life form from which they may have no hope of escape.

The strength of the story is also in its simplicity, and Alvarez uses swift pacing and straightforward character development to create an irresistible hook for audiences. He creates a crackerjack blend of suspense, horror, and science fiction that not only hearkens back to the original films, but also offers up something fresh and modernized for a new generation. Even better, the film is very dark and isn’t dumbed down for casual viewers, which shows a great deal of respect to long-time sci-fi fans. This isn’t just another sequel that is exploiting a franchise’s good will, it actually has some substance.

There’s an atmosphere of dread that commands most of the movie, and the action scenes are imaginative and inspired. I was on the edge of my seat multiple times, and several of the set pieces are visually fun, too. The special effects are not flashy or over-polished like the ones that tend to dominate modern blockbusters (even the alien creature itself remains largely unchanged from its original, iconic 1979 design), which turns out to be the perfect complement to the film’s strong narrative foundation. Heightened tension and fear is created through well-crafted suspense rather than constant visual bombardment. There’s a level of sophistication here that elevates it beyond a mere retread of past “Alien” films.

I was especially surprised about how quickly I started to care about the characters, who don’t exactly give off the best first impression (they seem like they will be stereotypical and highly annoying, but that’s not the case). As the story unfolds, so do the layers of depth and complexity, both which make the fate of these friends matter. The film is well cast, and Spaeny’s versatility shines through in a role that requires both emotional range and physical intensity.

The film is willing to take risks, especially when it comes to killing off characters. The unpredictability of who will survive and who has the wits to escape from harrowing situations adds another layer of tension and sense of danger. Nothing here feels preordained, and that in itself is exciting.

“Alien: Romulus” is a wildly satisfying addition to the franchise because it’s a film that understands what made the original great and uses those elements to create something new and exciting. It succeeds in paying homage to its predecessors while also forging its own identity, honoring its legacy in a way that will have sci-fi nerds salivating for future installments.

""Alien: Romulus is an impressive technical spectacle that highlights Fede Álvarez's talent in creating an atmosphere of tension and horror, raising the audiovisual standard of the saga to new heights through immersive sound design and Galo Olivares' stunning cinematography, which deserves countless accolades.

However, its excessive reliance on references to the past prevents it from reaching its full narrative potential, as well as achieving a thematic impact similar to the franchise's best installments.

Despite this, the captivating performances of Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson, along with a third act filled with insane entertainment, make this interquel a cinematic experience worth seeing in IMAX, even if it leaves the feeling that it could have been more daring and innovative.""

945961,Alien: Romulus,"Well, it was done appreciating the first Alien film, but it’s still offered nothing new for me.",7.0
945961,Alien: Romulus,"Alien: Romulus is a love letter to the 1979 classic, and while I dug the whole philosophical space-god thing in Prometheus, this stripped-down, back-to-basics approach had me hooked from the first frame.  It's been a while since an Alien film truly captured that sense of claustrophobic dread, and Romulus nails it.

This movie is gorgeous, plain and simple. The lighting, the camera angles, and Benjamin Wallfisch's score – it all blends together to create this constant tension that just sucks you in. There's this one scene where Rain, Andy and Tyler are being chased through the research station, the way they use the shadows and movement, it's like a masterclass in suspense. It totally reminded me of the most terrifying moments from the original. It's obvious Álvarez was obsessed with recreating that gritty, lived-in feel of the first Alien, and it pays off big time.

The cast is solid too. Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson absolutely kill it as Rain and Andy.  I'll admit, I was worried Andy would be your typical forgettable sidekick, but he actually gets a pretty interesting arc.  Sure, most of the crew are basically there to get picked off by the Xenomorph, but Andy was a standout supporting character. He basically played two roles. It's refreshing that the movie doesn't waste time with a bunch of unnecessary characters.

One thing this movie does really well is finding that sweet spot between horror and action that made the first two films so iconic.  Alien 3 was so bleak, and Resurrection was just bonkers action – this one feels like a proper blend of both.  Fede Álvarez basically throws in all the best Alien tropes: the ragtag crew, the creepy body horror stuff, the tense hide-and-seek scenes, and some kickass action sequences. And you know what? It totally works.

I was impressed at a lot of the creative set pieces and how they built tension. Like how they played with gravity to avoid the acid and trying to sneak past the facehuggers by camoflaging their body temperature. They were really cool and shockingly unique and fresh for a nearly 50 old franchise. And let's talk about that body horror. There's this one scene, a seriously messed-up vaginal birth, that is going to be burned into my brain for a while. Álvarez definitely gets what makes this franchise tick.

I'm giving Alien: Romulus a strong 7/10.  It lost some points for the use of the CGI Ian Holm. It's so distracting, and they rely on it way too much.  Also, there some lines that were stuck in there for nostalgia that felt out of place.  But honestly, those are minor nitpicks in a movie that's this much fun. The whole final act, with the station crashing into the asteroid field and that epic showdown with the Human/ Xeno, is just pure chaos in the best way possible.

The acting was overall very good. Cailee Spaeny as the lead actress gave a solid performance as expected. But the surprise of the movie was David Jonsson as her android ""brother"", who was the highlight of the movie actingwise for me.

Another main thing to mention are the effects and set desing. A lot of great practical effects, lighting and cinematography and the set design which is faithful to that of the first 2 Alien movies make this movie a great enjoyment for anyone who like the.

945961,Alien: Romulus,"""Alien: Romulus"" is a visually admirable film, but it really has nothing new to show us and even worse than that it has nothing fresh to say. It is merely content to plunder inspiration from the preceding films and the only entry in the series which appears to be left unplundered is ""Alien 3"" (1992), but then this omission can hardly be described as surprising. After all, it isn't held in particularly high regard by the legions of loyal fans who absolutely adore these films for their often groundbreaking achievements and idolise the inexhaustible resourcefulness of Ellen Ripley. Unfortunately, these same loyal fans aren't going to find anything worth adoring or idolising in this latest effort. It is still a reasonably entertaining motion picture, but only because you can spend most of the running time attempting to guess which scene comes from which film in order to appease your overwhelming sense of disappointment with it all.",6.0
945961,Alien: Romulus,"The Alien franchise has had its ups and downs with mostly the latter in recent years.

The classic line, ""Getaway from her you bitch"" was delivered as great as Bale's ""I'll be back"" from Terminator Salvation (meaning not very well).

945961,Alien: Romulus,"Fede Álvarez delivers a film in Alien: Romulus that tries to revitalize the franchise but stumbles on several key aspects. While visually appealing and faithful to the oppressive atmosphere characteristic of the saga, the movie lacks a solid narrative and memorable characters.

The script relies too heavily on genre clichés, with bland dialogue and unconvincing decisions from its protagonists. Attempts to explore philosophical themes about survival and human nature remain superficial, leaving the impression that the film tries to tackle more than it can handle.

Álvarez’s direction, which has shone in the past with more intimate horror projects, feels overwhelmed in such an established universe. The moments of tension and terror fail to achieve the desired impact, falling into an uneven rhythm that alternates between dull and predictable.

For the most devoted fans of Alien, this installment is particularly disappointing. In an unfortunate parallel to Disney's mishandling of the Star Wars saga, Romulus feels like a production that prioritizes franchise formulas over true innovation or respect for the original spirit. Rather than expanding the Alien legacy, the film dilutes it, leaving a bitter aftertaste for fans who had expected much more.

653346,Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,"Quick question. So it was a virus that led to the role reversal between the speaking humans and their ape counterparts? Now the apes have the upper hand and humanity is back in the caves. What I don't really get is why everything is in ruins and why there's an escalator in the middle of a forest full of zebras? Speech is crucial for communication, granted, but as the apes now thrive amidst the ruins of human construction I couldn't quite figure out why it was all decimated in the first place. Was there a war? Did I miss it? Anyway, Simian society still claims derivation from ""Caesar"" and in typical human fashion is just as divided. The apes live a peaceful life stealing the eagle's eggs from precariously perched nests so they can rear them themselves - and the eagles don't really seem to mind. The militaristic gorillas raid their village and drag them all to the seaside resort of ""Proximus"" where he is trying to break into an human, subterranean, vault. The raid caused havoc amongst the peaceable apes and left only ""Noa"" to try to free them. En route, he encounters ""Mae"" (Freya Allan) - an human who can speak, and upon arrival she befriends another talking person ""Trevathan"" (William H. Macy) who are both expected to help reach the treasures of the vault. She knows what's in there, and with the help of her new friends hopes to salvage what she was sent to retrieve - but without allowing any weapons inside to fall into enemy hands. It takes far too long to get going, this, but once we've established who is who and the story has kicked in, it's quite an exciting tale with some great visuals effects and just a little philosophy to keep it from falling into a trap of franchise mundanity. The acting isn't really up to much, but an enthusiastic effort from Kevin Durand as the menacing leader and some authentic looking acrobatics not seen since Johnny Weissmuller make for an entertaining episode in what is clearly a soap-style plot development where this is but an episode in a what happens next scenario.",7.0
653346,Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,"Has its moments, though overall I kinda found <em>'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes'</em> a bit of a slog to sit through.

The original trilogy are films that I do enjoy, they're very good. This fourth installment, however, underwhelmed me throughout its 145 minute run time. It starts off a new plot, obviously given how <em>'War for the Planet of the Apes'</em> concluded, and the new characters and their stories didn't really interest me.

Some of the action is watchable, the military bunker angle is decent, the visual effects are strong (but we already knew that) and the bits directly with Noa and Raka are the film's best in my opinion. I don't, though, really recall much else about this and remember feeling quite nonplussed whilst watching; the literal final music-filled shot got me pumped though, out of nowhere. None of the cast (voice or otherwise) stand out, either.

Sure, it doesn't have as grandiose a story as Caesar's but it does a grand job of world building and showing us how the ape society of the distant future is functioning. The exploration of the mythology which has built up with regards to their past and Caesar's time is also interesting.

Proximus isn't even really a villain as such, which makes him and his vision for the future a nice counter to the uncertain goals of Noa's human companion.

Particularly enjoyed the ending, which, when you realise it is coming, you have to laugh as it has been set up throughout the movie.

And the little kicker was good too. Setting us up nicely for a sequel which may see this reboot series veer back towards it's origins.

653346,Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,"""Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes"" is a thrilling continuation of the acclaimed franchise, directed by Wes Ball. The film dives deeper into the evolving society of intelligent apes, showcasing stunning visual effects and a compelling narrative that explores themes of leadership, conflict, and coexistence. The performances, particularly by Andy Serkis as Caesar, are powerful and emotive, bringing depth to the characters and the story. With its blend of action, drama, and thought-provoking themes, ""Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes"" is a captivating addition to the series that will resonate with fans and newcomers alike.",8.0
653346,Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,"Whilst Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is a competent and moderately entertaining addition to the franchise, I do wonder if there really was a need to make it? 

Kingdom (as I'll refer to it) is entertaining but it really does little, in this reviewers estimation, to move the franchise forward in a meaningful way. Its story is rather formulaic and you do quickly feel like you have ""seen it all before"", in one form or another. 

Having said this, I do not think Kingdom is a bad film. That would be unfair. Its CGI is top notch, as I said its story is basic but it does work, with well paced, varied action. Commendably, they even managed a little human/ape interest, which lifts the characters beyond being mere, cardboard cut outs.  

In summary, entertaining, watchable but really as far as I can see, nothing new is on offer here, either. Perhaps I'm being a little harsh but it would be nice, to see some genuine originality from Hollywood. They could do it once, why not now?",6.0
653346,Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,"The Planet of the Apes prequel films have been nothing short of astonishing, and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes continues this trend with remarkable filmmaking. The decision to set this installment 300 years after the previous films, yet still focus on Caesar's legacy, was a brilliant move. It effectively addresses the absence of Andy Serkis and Caesar by weaving his influence throughout the narrative.

Our protagonist Noah and his clan emerge as standout characters, bringing new life to the series. Their dynamic and struggles are compelling, adding depth to the narrative. Proximus Caesar serves as an effective villain, embodying the darker aspects of Caesar's legacy. His complex motivations and ruthless tactics provide a formidable challenge for Noah and his allies. 

My biggest gripe with the film lies in the portrayal of the human element. There is a lack of clarity regarding humanity's current state within this franchise. More understanding or explanation of humanity's status would have enriched the story. For instance, scenes involving humans operating missile silos 300 years after their construction strain credibility without sufficient backstory. A deeper exploration of how humanity has adapted or regressed over the centuries would have added valuable context.

Despite this flaw, the overall filmmaking remains top-notch. The visuals are stunning, with meticulous attention to detail in both the ape civilization and the post-apocalyptic landscapes. The special effects, particularly the motion capture work, are exceptional, bringing the apes to life with astonishing realism. 

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is a fantastic addition to the series, successfully balancing new elements with the rich legacy of Caesar. While the human storyline could benefit from greater depth and clarity, the film excels in its primary focus on the apes and their evolving society. This installment delivers a satisfying conclusion to the saga, and I would be content if the series ended here, preserving the integrity of Caesar's legacy and the high standards set by these prequels.",7.0

The humans are preoccupied with a vault containing all that is needed to get the satellite communications started again. Could this possibly be a tantalising precursor to perhaps yet another film? But if so, where would another film lead? It can only lead in a circle with the apes and the humans battling it out over who will have dominance over the entire planet. Anyway, this current installment is slow moving for the most part, although it is also wonderfully entertaining and the visual effects are a tremendous triumph as with all the other preceding films.",8.0
558449,Gladiator II,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://talkingfilms.net/gladiator-ii-review-a-legacy-sequel-that-triumphs-through-spectacle-and-emotion/

""Gladiator II may not achieve the groundbreaking impact of the original film, but it remains an impressive cinematic experience, transporting audiences into an epic filled with emotional and visual grandeur.

Ridley Scott once again showcases his mastery in blending narrative, action, and thematic depth, delivering a sequel marked by superb technical execution and standout performances, particularly from Denzel Washington. Despite the inevitable comparisons to the classic, the iconic filmmaker presents a story that justifies its existence, even if it treads familiar ground.

Necessary or not, what truly matters is the strength (and honor) with which a work captivates us - and here, Gladiator II triumphs.""

558449,Gladiator II,Another trash Woke movie from Hollywood. There were never black (African) emperors in Roman empire... This movie is simply false propaganda.,1.0
558449,Gladiator II,"_Gladiator II_, a polished echo of the original, is a testament to Ridley Scott's cinematic powers. It follows his hit-and-miss _Napoleon_ biopic last year, which was rather miss than hit. The sequel captures the original's essence while introducing elements, making it a worthy successor.

Paul Mescal in the lead role - inherited from the ever-growling Russel Crowe, who was at the top of his career in the original - holds his ground against Denzel Washington, whose charisma cleaves through the screen as effortlessly as his character's sword.

Ridley Scott admits he was prompted to revisit _Gladiator_ by the acclaim he received from those too young to have seen the original on the big screen. His mission to lure Gen Z away from their streaming devices may help to save cinema, ushering in a new era of appreciation for the big screen. But for the love of Jupiter, I hope they quickly learn that it isn't just a big iPad with comfy chairs. No pausing, swiping, mid-film selfies, dashes to the bar, or running commentary required. Screen four at your local cinema isn't the Colosseum but a place where the magic of film of this scale truly comes alive, offering a unique and immersive experience that can't be replicated at home.",8.0
558449,Gladiator II,"<em>'Gladiator II'</em> is awesome!

I only watched the original three years ago, almost to the day in fact, but I was anticipating this follow-up after thoroughly loving the Russell Crowe film. Honestly, I think I kinda enjoyed this sequel more - at worst, the two are on the same level, for me anyway. Crowe is missed, though everyone in this movie more than makes up for his (obvious) absence.

This is the first time I've seen Paul Mescal act, despite knowing of him for quite a while now. I'm impressed! He delivers a showing of great strength (pardon the pun). Pedro Pascal is very good too, as is Joseph Quinn; I wasn't instantly sold on the latter when he appeared onscreen, though when all is said and done I rate his performance positively.

Denzel Washington... what a geezer. I'll never tire or turn down the chance at seeing that man act. Needless to say, given he's one of two favourite actors of mine, I loved his performance all the way through. The likes of Fred Hechinger and Connie Nielsen merit fair praise as well, interesting to see Rory McCann and Matt Lucas in there too.

Oh, and the score... superb! Deafeningly grand.",9.0
558449,Gladiator II,"Sixteen years after ""Maximus"" (Russell Crowe) bit the dust, we find ancient Rome under the control of twins ""Geta"" (Joseph Quinn) and his brother ""Caracalla"" (Fred Hechinger) and thanks to their general ""Acacias"" (Pedro Pascal) continuing to expand their empire. It's this latter man who leads an attack on the home ""Nanno"" (Paul Mescal) shares with his wife ""Arishat"" (Yuval Gonen). That doesn't go so well and next thing, she's gone on ahead of him to the wheat fields and he's now a slave owned by the manipulative ""Macrinus"" (Denzel Washington) heading to the Colosseum to entertain the emperors and their cousin ""Lucilla"" (Connie Nielsen). What now ensues is a well produced and good looking rehash of the first film paying homage en route to ""Spartacus"" and it's the sheer predicability that I struggled with. It's episodically delivered with far too much script and though Mescal tries hard, his performance is largely charm-free and as wooden as a rudius, especially once the rather far-fetched familial back-story has been established. Sir Derek Jacobi sparingly appears as the other survivor from 2000 reprising his role as the senator ""Gracchus"" but to no real effect and the scene stealer for me is really only the megalomanic Quinn's imperial offering as he and his bonkers sibling teeter on the brink of inbred, sexually fluid, madness. Washington does well enough as the scheming slave-master, but he hasn't really enough to work with to stand out amongst what really are a mediocre collection of undercooked characters that just don't deliver any real sense of the hedonism and menace of this debauched and corrupt state. As with Sir Ridley Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (2005) the battle scenes are superb and action packed, as are the combat scenes in the vast marble auditorium filled with baying plebs and rhinos, but I am afraid that the shallow characterisations just didn't work well enough to keep this engaging and the plot was just too thin to stretch over a couple of hours that could have been so very much better. It really does need a big screen to appreciate the creatively crafted visuals, but I was still pretty disappointed, sorry.",6.0
558449,Gladiator II,"Comparisons will be inevitable and Gladiator II will never be as iconic as the 2000 classic. However it is very good, strong all-around with gripping action and a well executed script. Performances are very good, with some pleasant surprises.",7.0
558449,Gladiator II,"Gladiator II features some impressive action sequences. Every battle in the Colosseum is fantastic despite how historically inaccurate they may be. The monkey sequence showcases how skilled Hanno (Paul Mescal) is not only as a fighter but also in how he interacts with others. Then there's the rhino sequence that plays out much like Bugs Bunny’s interactions with Toro the Bull in the Chuck Jones-directed Looney Tunes short Bully for Bugs (1953).

While those sequences are fairly believable, the shark sequence seems like pure fantasy and that’s why it’s so incredible. They fill the Colosseum with water and let sharks loose while the opposing gladiators try to survive the onslaught on boats.

It’s also interesting to note that every major actor who dies in the film has a spectacular death. Not only that but these gruesome deaths get increasingly more grisly and memorable as the film progresses. These bloody triumphs rarely delve any deeper than someone getting shot with a bunch of arrows or a beheading or appendage severing of some kind. This level of brutality escalates throughout the film and eventually culminates with the most satisfying kill that takes two and a half hours to achieve.

The performances fluctuate between being top-tier perfection and mediocre overacting. Denzel Washington is having the time of his life as Macrinus. He has the most interesting storyline and Denzel dances in every scene with a giddiness that is unparalleled. Joseph Quinn seems to be acting in an entirely different film than everyone else as Emperor Geta. His mannerisms are operatic and theatrical with his wide eyes that rarely blink, grand body language and hand gestures, and explosive line delivery.

Pedro Pascal doesn’t do anything in Gladiator II as Marcus Acacius that he didn’t do in Game of Thrones apart from having more screen time. Much like how his character is written, Paul Mescal’s performance is muddled. The Hanno character and who he is is a poorly kept secret that consistently pulls the character in several directions.

Hanno is vengeful at first before succumbing to being the hero of the film and the evolution isn’t earned. The writing and pacing of Gladiator II feel like the film drops Hanno’s fate in his lap halfway through, which he’s either forgotten about over two decades or never knew until the audience did.

Connie Nielsen, one of the few returning actors from the original film, is awful in this. Her acting in Gladiator II always comes off as forced as her crying scenes are often portrayed as constipated grunts with crocodile tears. Her dialogue delivery is also strained and broken despite being given some of the most important sequences of character connections and reawakenings of sorts in the sequel.

Calling Gladiator II action-heavy is misleading because the film drags between every fight sequence. The film is largely dull and difficult to indulge during its quieter moments. The film is gorgeous with its incredible set pieces, intricate costume design, and impressive use of infinitely numerous extras. Director Ridley Scott reunites with all of the set decorators (Sonja Klaus, Crispian Sallis, and Emilio Ardura) and costume designer (Janty Yates) that he worked with on Gladiator in 2000. From a visual standpoint, Ridley Scott's films are highly detailed masterpieces.

Denzel Washington’s extravagant performance makes Gladiator II worthwhile. Still, not even its excessively violent action sequences, beautiful cinematography, and masterful set and costume design can save the sequel from how boring it is. Ridley Scott waited over twenty years to make a sequel that is more than twice as expensive as the original only to rehash the same story points.",5.0
558449,Gladiator II,"pssst.... it's woke, but that's no surprise.

What is a surprise is that people are giving spoiler alerts.  I don't understand why.  Like so many movie squeals and reboots what you have here is Gladiator with everything intelligent and entertaining sucked out of it.  So it's the same movie, but shorter.  There are two emperors rather than ones.  Rome is falling, but not from the debauchery, intellectual laziness, and over stretched militarism that really caused it's fall... that would be anti-woke to point out it collapsed for all the reasons they love.  Instead some lazy leftism the right is evil crap, peppered with fiery but mostly peaceful protests blamed on the thinly veiled reference to Trump.

Gladiator lite (II) mimics its predecessor but its predominantly just a bare essentials remake of a superior, original film. The story is a rather basic ""almost"" version of the year 2000 film starring Russell Crowe, the protagonists more or less fill the same or similar roles and well, that's about it. Oh but for a dash of difference, they do have CGI sharks, monkey's and rhino's, if, for whatever weird reason, that's your thing.

558449,Gladiator II,"When Ridley Scott decided to revisit Gladiator, it sounded like an opportunity to expand on one of the greatest historical epics. Instead, we got a rehash that feels more like a missed opportunity than a bold sequel.

The first act rushes through familiar territory. A general, born out of combat, loses his family and ends up as a slave. Sound familiar? It’s the same setup as Maximus’s story, minus the emotional weight. And sending Lucilla’s son away to protect him? That’s not just a weak plot point, it spits on everything Maximus and Marcus died for.

The second act brings nothing new to the table. The “twist” is predictable, the plot messy, and the villains uninspired. Commodus worked because he was layered, a mix of insecurity and cruelty. Here, the two emperors are generic placeholders. Even the attempted coup feels like déjà vu, with none of the intensity or buildup that made the first movie iconic.

The third act delivers a visually stunning battle but lacks substance. The final showdown offers nothing fresh, and the death of the antagonist in front of everyone feels like it’s trying to copy the original. The speech about “Maximus and Marcus’s dream”? We’ve heard it before, and it meant more the first time.

What was the point of that last scene? There were so many ways to end this movie with a high note, something meaningful to honor Lucilla or Acacius. Instead, we get a hollow, pointless ending that adds nothing to the story.

Credit where it’s due: the cinematography, CGI, and score are outstanding. Visually, the movie is a masterpiece, with breathtaking scenery and polished editing. The music, while clearly inspired by the original, carries the mood well. But great visuals can’t save a story that refuses to move forward.

As for the central narrative about Maximus Meridius’ son? Trivial and painfully predictable. The ""legacy revenge"" arc is telegraphed so clearly you could write the script after the first act. No twists, no depth—just a paint-by-numbers retread of the original’s emotional beats.

""Civil War attests to Alex Garland’s fascinating ability to create impactful narratives that provoke deep discussions, beyond his unwavering commitment to the themes and characters at hand, without falling into preachy stances.

A film that transcends political boundaries, focusing on war journalism, the moral dilemmas faced by those who risk their lives to tell stories that cannot be ignored, and the personal transformation necessary to carry out such an inhuman task. The character complexity and the chilling intensity of the cinematography and sound production contribute to a powerfully engaging, repeatedly shocking audiovisual experience.

Engrossing viewing. Highly recommended. Very much want to rewatch it already.",9.0
929590,Civil War,"Nope, sorry, this just didn't work for me. It appears that there is a civil war amongst these United States. California and Texas have seceded from the Union and Florida seems to be having a wobble too. The President (Nick Offerman) makes a speech assuring the rest of his country that they've nothing to worry about, but hardened photo-journalist ""Lee"" (Kirsten Dunst) and her cohort ""Joel"" (Wagner Moura) reckon that the conflict is quite likely to come to an altogether different conclusion. They bravely decide to travel the 800-odd miles to Washington DC to try and interview him. Their out-of-shape veteran associate ""Sammy"" (Stephen McKinley Henderson) thinks they are mad, but also wants in on the trip. Meantime, the enthusiastic young photographer ""Jessie"" (Cailee Spaeny) has managed to hook up with the team and so, rather implausibly, they agree to take her on this perilous journey. It's that implausibility that carries the whole thing as the completely preposterous scenario unfolds before us. No effort is made to fill us in on the cause of this warfare. Did the President seize power? Was he elected from a party these states didn't vote for? Are they just brutal and well armed revolutionaries? Then we have the ridiculous dialogue - usually from Henderson with his ""always take fuel when you can"" or ""this way only leads to death"" type profundities as the group travel through a remarkably stable, well fuelled and provisioned, nation where there's hardly the merest hint of mass migrations, fear or terror. Indeed, their blue ""Press"" helmets and a little bit of kevlar seem to render them immune to the deadly drama that they are supposed to be experiencing. Jesse Plemons makes a brief appearance - that actually leads to the only vaguely exciting part of this chronology, but otherwise it's all a bit on a non-event. Dunst starts off as a strong and characterful woman but that dwindles away and, well, I was just a bit bored as the denouement hoved into view with all the predicability of the sun coming up. It's bitty, episodic, unrealistic and populated with characters in whom I simply could not believe. Sure, maybe it's supposed to be outlandishly apocalyptic, but it reminded me for the most part of an episode of ""Falling Skies"" - only without the aliens. Perhaps it might resonate better with an American audience? I'm not one of them and this didn't.",6.0
929590,Civil War,"Cautionary tales often have some of the most significant impact when brought to life on the big screen, and that’s certainly the case with the latest offering from writer-director Alex Garland. The filmmaker’s gripping tale of a quartet of journalists (Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Cailee Spaeny) covering a civil war in a dystopian version of America of the near future follows the reporters as they make their way from New York to Washington via a circuitous route that shows them all sides of this nightmarish scenario. Essentially a road trip film, “Civil War” provides the principals and viewers with an array of images and situations graphically depicting what’s left of the US as a distraught population attempts to make sense of the circumstances and find ways to survive. The purpose of the protagonists’ journey is to secure an interview (likely the last one) with a corrupt, egomaniacal President (Nick Offerman) as rebel forces close in on the capital. They set out on this treacherous odyssey despite the dangers involved both in making the trip and in their roles as journalists, who are looked on with suspicion and have been accused of fanning the flames of the hostilities. While some have complained that the film doesn’t provide enough social and political background about the conflict, I submit that this consideration is fundamentally unnecessary: Garland is making an unadulterated statement here that, when the bullets start flying, ideology won’t matter and no one will care, a point driven home with chilling clarity over and over. The madness that consumes the population is all that’s important at that juncture, one driven by bald-faced hostility on steroids both among the combatants and the overzealousness of the reporters in seeking to “get the story,” no matter what. In achieving this end, the filmmaker holds nothing back, making this an often-difficult watch, one definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart. But the picture’s message is one of grave importance, especially in today’s trying, polarized climate. We’d be wise to pay attention to what’s being said in this important work, handily the best – and most troubling – release of 2024 thus far.",8.0
929590,Civil War,"The film, although set in a context of armed conflict, deviates from the traditional war theme to focus on war photojournalists, promoting a perspective on the work of such professionals. Through a series of small scenes, the director seeks to compose a portrait of these professionals' actions on the battlefield without declaring the reasons for the war or identifying the sides involved.

Each scene, individually, is well-executed, standing out for the quality of cinematography and an immersive sound work that amplifies the tension. However, these scenes, although effective individually, fail to come together cohesively. The result is a film that seems less than the sum of its parts. The main problem with the film is a lack of depth.

Although technically well-produced, particularly in terms of audio, the film falls short of a deeper approach, which could have elevated it from a mere display of impactful scenes to a truly impactful work.",7.0
929590,Civil War,"In spite of its pretensions, Civil War is essentially a derivative affair filled with  calculatedly disturbing visuals and violent exposition.

Character development and a functioning back story are largely absent, from Civil War. This is an exposition driven road trip from hell, with a nihilistic objective, that plays out to a predictable conclusion. 

That does not really leave a lot, for the viewer, to take away from this film. A film which should have a lot to say but is, instead, conspicuously silent. Perhaps this is a reaction to the climate of division and fear that exists in the USA today? That said, why make a film about something contentious, if you have nothing contentious to say?

929590,Civil War,"I was very interested in watching Civil War for a number of reasons. Mainly I wanted to see how the various political sides were portrayed in the very divided ""United"" States.  Indeed, there are many countries in the world that are near evenly split amongst two groups: High Government Involvement (money, immigration, etc.) vs. Free Market Capitalism.

Unfortunately, there was no coverage of that in Civil War, with the only difference being regions, letting you imagine on your own the differences. They are relying on a regional stereotype to push that the ""South"" is made up of angry white people that just like killing those that don't agree with them.  That put the movie right away into a political category.

When the movie had finished, I was left with some lasting feelings that were intentionally pushed by the story and director:
1) the international press are the only real heroes; 2) all American white men just like war and killing.

It's unfortunate that this seemed to be the main narrative from start to finish. There were so many missed opportunities.

Summary:  The was like a little like watching the movie Apocalypse Now with the sole main character being the press photographer who was always portrayed as the hero.

The writer and director pushed that those many wartime videographers had a large audience that only desired seeing the upclose expressions from people that were shot and dying. They also pushed that they would be so highly respected and protected from all waring sides. Those continual assumptions caused the movie to lose significant realism.

With such a large production budget and vast thirst for this movie topic, Civil War was a major letdown. Better writing and direction could have made this a movie blockbuster. Instead, it won't be remembered in 3-5 years, and certainly no one would every consider rewatching it.",3.0

He arrives to find that she has committed suicide and a cursory investigation from her FBI daughter ""Verona"" (Emmy Raver-Lampman) reveals she was the victim of a callous scam that wiped out not just her savings, but $2 million from a charity she chaired. Yep, you've guessed it. ""Clay"" decides it's time to reactivate his account and get on the trail of these people regardless of just how high up the food chain the trail of complicity and corruption leads. Statham adopts a rather curious accent throughout this totally unoriginal and derivative action thriller that gets gradually more preposterous as it goes on. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons add a little box-office to the thing, but their roles are undercooked and the former is actually pretty hopeless throughout. Some fun pyrotechnics and you wouldn't ever want to mess with ""Clay"" but these one-man assassination squad movies are ten a penny now and this is certainly not one of the best.",6.0

866398,The Beekeeper,"I watched all the The ___ movies in preparation for the most expensive, The Beekeeper. It's short, snappy and dumb. Statham kills people like usual. Just a hard-working American bloke who only ever wanted to be cared for. If you feel all Australians are goofy and should die, you'll really like the end and probably rate it higher than I did.",6.0
866398,The Beekeeper,"Dumb as a brick. I'm sorry but the story behind this is downright moronic,  not helped by shallow or aimless characterisations, absurd action, empty dialogue and no real finale.

866398,The Beekeeper,"I'm conflicted about <em>'The Beekeeper'</em>.

On the one hand, it's fantastic entertainment as Jason Statham plays a brilliantly badass character - every scene with him is top, top notch. The editing, action and score are positives, though everything around those aforementioned elements is annoyingly very hit-and-miss... and I'm not sure how much the other bits affect my enjoyment.

Away from the great Statham, the cast are also up-and-down. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons are decent, I think inferior actors would've done much worse so those two do do well in fairness. Sadly, for Emmy Raver-Lampman & Co. on the FBI side of the story... not the best. I mean, they're OK but kinda boring at the same time.

Raver-Lampman's character is also quite lamely written, not the actress' fault of course but still. Without spoiling anything, I feel like her character should've been way more sympathetic to Clay's cause given the obvious - like, still 'do your job' absolutely but it's as if the character forgot what happened at the start of the movie.

The scummy organizations are also portrayed a bit too cartoony, based on what I've seen in real life about those sorta people is that they're usually lousy losers who happen to know how to do what they do - rather than 'Gen Z' (please do forgive me for using that term *shudder*) smartasses who party 24/7 as this 2024 release shows.

I'm happy with the rating I've settled on, Statham merited more though.",8.0
866398,The Beekeeper,"**The Beekeeper** is a serviceable action thriller that delivers what you would expect from a _Jason Statham_ vehicle: brutal fights, cheesy one-liners, and a simple revenge plot. The film is directed by David Ayer, who has a knack for creating gritty and violent urban settings, and written by Kurt Wimmer, who has a penchant for crafting absurd and convoluted sci-fi scenarios. The result is a mashup of John Wick, The Equalizer, and The Matrix, with a dash of bee-related humor and symbolism.

**Statham** plays _Adam Clay_, a reclusive beekeeper who lives on a farm owned by his elderly friend _Eloise Parker_ (**Phylicia Rashad**). When Eloise falls victim to a phishing scam orchestrated by a sinister tech company, Adam decides to use his skills as a former elite operative to track down and punish the culprits. Along the way, he encounters various obstacles and enemies, such as corrupt cops, hired goons, and a mysterious hacker known as The Queen (Ruby Rose). He also forms an unlikely alliance with Eloise's daughter, FBI agent Sarah Parker (**Emmy Raver-Lampman**), who is investigating the same case.

The film does not waste much time on exposition or character development, focusing instead on the action sequences and the spectacle. Statham is in his element as the stoic and efficient killing machine, dispatching his foes with a variety of weapons and martial arts moves. He also delivers some witty and sarcastic remarks, often involving bees or honey. The supporting cast is mostly forgettable, except for Rashad, who brings some warmth and dignity to her role, and Rose, who plays the villain with a mix of charm and menace.

The film's biggest flaw is its lack of originality and coherence. The plot is a generic and predictable revenge story, with some implausible twists and turns. The film also tries to incorporate some themes and messages about technology, society, and morality, but they are either underdeveloped or contradictory. For example, the film seems to criticize the dangers of data mining and online fraud, but also glorifies the use of hacking and surveillance by the protagonist. The film also uses the bee motif as a metaphor for Adam's identity and mission, but it is often inconsistent and superficial.

The Beekeeper is not a film that will challenge or surprise you, but it is a film that will entertain you if you are in the mood for some mindless and fun action. It is a popcorn flick that knows its strengths and limitations, and delivers on its promise of Statham kicking ass and cracking jokes. If you are a fan of his previous works, or of the action genre in general, you will probably enjoy this film. Just don't expect anything more than that.",9.0
866398,The Beekeeper,"Been there, seen that (a dozen times!). This movie follows the same tired trope of a rogue US government agent. Hollywood, how many more can there be?  If you're looking for something original, skip this one.",
866398,The Beekeeper,"I have to be honest and say that, if far left Hollywood had not turned out one woke turd after another but actually good movies as they used to a long time ago, this one might not have earned five out of five stars from me.

But since the Hollywood pedophiles have more or less ruined everything they touch the competition for good movies is more or less non-existent so here we go.

The movie is pretty much free of woke bullshit and far left preaching so that alone earns it at least two stars.

This movie is very much a John Wick style movie. Some dumbass criminals piss off the wrong guy and a fireworks display of martial arts and dead criminals follows.

Jason Statham, as Adam Clay aka The Beekeeper, is really at his best in this movie. He is a kick-ass, relentless, stone hard, killer focused on both revenge and the eradication of the human scum that preys on the weak and, in this case, stupid.

The bad guys, at least at the start, is an organization that runs on-line scams. When scamming the person that has taken Adam under her wings after his retirement it has unforeseen and tragic consequences.

Later in the movie this simple plot evolves, as the blurb states, to a national emergency due to the corrupt and criminal actors involved at high levels.

When I watched the movie I really thought that this entire scamming things was a bit unrealistic. I mean come on, people cannot be that stupid! But then I reminded myself that people also, allegedly, voted for a senile turnip brain with a kackling moron as vice president so I guess they can be.

As I wrote, Statham is really at his best. If we should compare with John Wick again, Statham is much more menacing and vengeful than Keanu Reeves ever was in John Wick.

I really like how the criminal asshats at all levels gradually gets their rightful, and usually terminal, punishment and that they most of the time gets to see and sweat as their doom approaches.

Also, the stunts are not at all as exaggerated and ludicrous as in the fourth John Wick installment. That does not mean that they are very realistic but then that is not really to be expected in this kind of action movie.

The story overall is not bad. It is an action movie type of story which means it is fairly simplistic, it has plot holes and it is not overly realistic but that is fine. It is good enough and it is Statham that carries the movie anyway.

This was indeed one of the best movies in a long time as far as I am concerned. Pure entertainment.

Along the way, they encounter the hippie ""Martin"" (Rhys Ifans) and his family and cadge a lift in their VW camper-van whilst offering a fairly tuneless rendition of some David Bowie. It all builds up to a fairly predictable denouement with humanity facing some tough choices, the seemingly indestructible aliens on the verge of success and our intrepid partnership having to consider the ultimate sacrifice. Yep, we've seen it all before and though the visual effects are pretty impressive, that's not really enough to sustain it as it rather procedurally rolls along. There is occasionally some wit in the script and Hardy looks like he's having fun, but Chiwetel Ejiofor is largely under-used and it relies far too heavily on repetitive combat scenes to really make it stand out amidst the surfeit of 2024 comic-book derivatives.

This latest and possibly last film in the series, ""Venom: The Last Dance"", is, I believe, the weakest in the line up. Unlike its predecessors, it feels a little bit rushed and somehow, anti climatic. That said, it still has its moments of engaging humour and not half decent action.

But man, the rest? A hot mess. The plot is all over the map, the new characters are forgettable, and the villain? Weak sauce. It feels like the filmmakers just kind of shrugged and said, “Eh, good enough.” Sure, there are flashes of that buddy-comedy charm, but not enough to save the movie from feeling like it’s limping to the finish line.

If this is the final Venom movie (and I hope it is), I’m not gonna cry about it. It’s a mixed bag—fun in bits, but overall, it’s like Venom himself: a bit too sloppy to fully love.",
1011985,Kung Fu Panda 4,"_Kung Fu Panda 4_ isn’t the best _Kung Fu Panda_ film, or even the best of the series’ three sequels. However, as a fourth film in a franchise, it’s a ton of fun.

And though it’s action isn’t quite as entertaining as its predecessors and it’s unfortunate to see Awkwafina playing yet another thief (_Jumanji: The Next Level_ says hello), for the most part, _Kung Fu Panda 4_ happily skadooshes its way to animated greatness.

1011985,Kung Fu Panda 4,"This is probably my favourite of the franchised animated action-comedies, but I think we are now clearly running out of conceptual steam. With ""Po"" being told by ""Master Shifu"" that it is now time for him to move onwards and upwards - much to his chagrin - he must recruit a new dragon warrior so he can retreat to more cerebral pastimes. Luckily, though, the ""Chameleon"" has designs on obtaining all the powers from those now consigned to the nether realm and using the powers of Kung Fu to take over the world. ""Po"" has to be put his promotion on hold and along with his new-found, and useful, foxy friend ""Zhen"" try to thwart these heinous ambitions. Though there's plenty of action and self-deprecating dialogue the storyline really is too much of a recycled affair. Even the panda has been drawn into the multi-verse and to be frank, I'm a bit bored with that theme now - especially as it's never really accompanied by much in the way of jeopardy. Yes, this is an entirely predicable story that, in this case, misses out on the characterisations of his pals from the ""Furious Five"". It's watchable and the story well paced; there's some fun to be had in the wobbly, mountain-top, tavern but I think I've already forgotten most of it.",6.0
1011985,Kung Fu Panda 4,"**Written by kindergartners using AI**

Even after more than 10 years, I still miss the first Kung Fu Panda movie as it was genuinely a masterpiece. The story, action, dialogues, character building, the tension between Tai Lung and Shifu, everything was fabulous. Well, I can go on and on about the first Kung Fu Panda, but this is about this unbearable trash Kung Fu Panda 4.

This movie is so bad that calling it boring would be a compliment. Out of nowhere, this Zhen character manifests. All the formula film scenes replicated, unnecessary fights, moving around without any purpose, cracking jokes (painfully unfunny) out of nowhere, and so on. I wanted to leave the movie after 20 minutes but then I thought maybe something good would happen. However, I was wrong till the end. 

Pathetic direction, dialogue delivery and unfunny jokes started feeling irritating. No chemistry between Po and Zhen, and somehow they both are ready to die for each other. The Zhen character was uninteresting and annoying.

Just like contemporary movies where people get everything without any sacrifice or struggle, they managed to ""Mary Sue"" Zhen by making her the next dragon warrior.

I am glad that this movie ended this way. At least now I know I won’t be watching any more trash from this franchise.

If you loved the first Kung Fu panda, please stay away from this. Please save and cherish your good memories. You have been warned.

Dialog writers need to remove certain words from their joke book, like ""method"", as in method acting. When I hear method acting, I think Jared Leto. Associating Jared Leto's ""method acting"" with your movie probably isn't a good thing. Method acting and Jared Leto occupied real estate rent free for the entirety of this movie. It didn't help that they couldn't stop themselves from thinking ""it's so nice, we'll say it twice"".

I reckon I'll be saying the exact same thing in X amount of months about this one, that doesn't necessarily mean a film is bad though - because this release isn't. The voices we hear are perfectly satisfactory, from Jack Black to Awkwafina, Viola Davis (the best, away from lead) and the rest.

The music here is good. There is one piece of the score, which is heard a couple of times and during the end credits, that must be a homage of sorts to television show <em>'Dexter'</em> - weird connection granted, but it sounds practically exactly the same to me.

On the note of the sound, I enjoyed Tenacious D's rock cover of ""...Baby One More Time"". I listened to it an embarrassing amount when it first released alongside this movie, the video was admittedly part of the reason why - I'm always a fan of seeing film casts in music videos.

746036,The Fall Guy,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://talkingfilms.net/the-fall-guy-review-a-thrilling-tribute-to-the-unsung-heroes-of-cinema/

""The Fall Guy emerges as a passionate ode to the brave, audacious stunt doubles, neglected by the film industry for so many decades. David Leitch offers an experience full of action, comedy, romance, and mystery, highlighted by the impressive physical feats performed by the stunt department, mostly without the aid of visual effects.

It’s a necessary tribute to those who risk their lives daily to elevate the entertainment power of cinema. Although it occasionally loses focus due to multiple storylines, the movie conveys a clear message about the importance of creative freedom and respect for all involved in filmmaking.

With charismatic performances by Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, as well as an energetic score by Dominic Lewis, this celebration of cinema and the hard work behind the scenes is one of this year’s must-see IMAX screenings.""

The cast are great, definitely the film's strongest part in my opinion. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are an all-star pair and I enjoyed them both, they worked well together. Hannah Waddingham and Aaron Taylor-Johnson add good showings too. Stephanie Hsu and Winston Duke are involved as well.

The story produces entertainment, even if it could've had more flavour added to it. I felt watching that in a few parts it does overstay its welcome ever so slightly, not for a negative impact but enough that I couldn't rate it any higher. All the stunt stuff is fantastic though, as it ought to be given the subject matter. It's solid humour-wise, my favourite bits were actually the background actor interactions; s/o wife's sister guy.

746036,The Fall Guy,"This does suffer a bit from having been trailed to death in the cinema, and the story is really pretty thin - but there's some engaging chemistry on display between the two stars as their adventures hot up. ""Colt"" (Ryan Gosling) is the stunt double for the all action hero ""Tom Ryder"" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) whilst sort of dating aspiring director ""Jody"" (Emily Blunt). An accident on set drives ""Colt"" away from the business altogether until a random call from producer ""Gail"" (Hannah Waddingham) informs him that ""Jody"" is to direct her first film in Australia and he has been especially requested! Of course he hadn't, and when he turns up - much to the surprise of the production, they sort of settle for a truce as he gets back into the swing of rolling cars and jumping from burning wreckage. Where's the star though? Well it transpires that's what ""Gail"" has really brought him to establish. He's gone AWOL. Not for the first time, ""Ryder"" is a bit flaky - but all ""Colt"" need do is track down their wayward pretty boy and then he can escape this embarrassing scenario and go back home. Needless to say, his investigations soon immerse him in a dangerous world of drugs, unicorns and even more car chasing and pyrotechnics. Can he find his charge and maybe even restore his romance? There's precisely no jeopardy with any of that, even if there is quite a daft twist in the tale at the end, but that doesn't matter. This is an excuse for some good looking people to have fun celebrating the life of the movie stuntman. It's good fun to watch with Gosling oozing charisma as we go along on a trip that reveals just a little of the smoke and mirrors that is routinely used to convince us that what we see on screen is real - and that nobody usually dies! Sydney harbour is used to good effect, though I maybe wouldn't have wanted to be the general manager of the opera house when their film crew turned up, and the dialogue is quite a witty mix of hackneyed metaphor, old lines from famous movies and plenty of corn and cheese. ATJ doesn't really feature so much, but when he does he's clearly taking a pop at all things vain and superficial about the cult of image, and Blunt looks like she is enjoying herself as she tries to get her film in the can despite her missing frontman, the wrong kind of sand on the beach and her clearly having the hots for her ex.

Overall, it's a fun, engaging movie that delivers an exciting cinematic experience.",
746036,The Fall Guy,"It bothers me that this film didn't perform better at the box office. This movie is an incredibly fun ride with a stellar cast and some of the best action sequences I've seen on the big screen in years. The chemistry among the cast members is truly fantastic, elevating the film's enjoyment factor.

The cast is a significant highlight, with each actor bringing their A-game. The interactions between characters feel genuine, adding a layer of authenticity to the high-octane action. The camaraderie between the lead and his team is palpable, making their collective journey more engaging. This dynamic is particularly evident in scenes where quick banter and teamwork are essential, showcasing their rapport and adding to the film's overall appeal. 

I can attest that there isn't much that a crew of professional filmmakers can't do together in a short amount time with a good plan. The stunt team most of all! 

The action sequences are top-notch, meticulously choreographed, and thrilling to watch. The film excels in creating high-energy moments that are both visually spectacular and narratively compelling. 

I find myself torn about the film's release platform. On one hand, I wish it had been released on streaming so more people could have easily accessed and enjoyed it. On the other hand, this is precisely the kind of movie that benefits from the immersive experience of a theater. The grandiose action sequences and stunning visuals are best appreciated on the big screen, where their impact is maximized.

The movie fits into the current trend of ""hero"" films that blend traditional tough-guy action with emotional depth and vulnerability. Unlike older action heroes who often suppressed their emotions, the protagonists in this film openly confront their mental health issues and emotional struggles. This approach adds a refreshing twist to the genre, making the characters more relatable and human. For example, the lead character's journey includes moments of introspection and personal growth, highlighting his inner battles alongside the external conflicts.

Overall, this movie is a fantastic blend of action, heart, and camaraderie. It's a film that deserves to be seen and appreciated by a wider audience.

I highly recommend checking it out, especially on the big screen, to fully experience its exhilarating and emotional ride.",8.0

426063,Nosferatu,"<em>'Nosferatu'</em> didn't quite hook me, but there is enough about it that I can consider it as a good film. The visuals are splendid, as are the gothic horror elements. On the cast, Lily-Rose Depp impresses, as does (more minimally) Emma Corrin and I'm always happy to see Willem Dafoe.

I do continue to feel quite nonplussed by Nicholas Hoult. I did like him in fellow 2024 release <em>'Juror #2'</em>, but in this I've kinda reverted to feeling unmoved by him onscreen. I'm not entirely sure why as he seems a likeable chap, yet his performances just don't really register - which admittedly sounds harsher than I intended.

Bill Skarsgård as Count Orlok is also a part of this flick that I'm unsure on. Does he look the real deal? Absolutely, no complaints there, but I particularly found the dialogue with him to be a borderline bumbling mess. I found the scenes directly with Count to be the least interesting.

I would also say that the movie goes on for a bit too long, though I admit that probably is more of a personal shout than one that is to be set in stone; because if you love this, it'll be the perfect length I'm sure. For me, I feel like they went around the houses a tad. With that said, I did highly enjoy that final scene with Depp - very good!

Those last paragraphs make it sound like I have a dislike for this film. I do not. It just has some noteworthy points that I felt the need to mention. As I type, having not looked at how this has been received, I'd be shocked if this wasn't rated high. Either way, this is worth a watch.

This is my third Robert Eggers film. I loved <em>'The Northman'</em> (9/10) but I, honestly, hated <em>'The Lighthouse'</em> (4/10).

426063,Nosferatu,"""Tom"" (Nicholas Hoult) is lovingly married to ""Ellen"" (Lily-Rose Depp) but they haven't much money. That could change, though, as his boss ""Knock"" (Simon McBurney) charges him with a very special mission. He must travel from his German home to the mountains of Carpathia where he must facilitate the sale of a ruined manor house to the reclusive ""Count Orlok"" (Bill Skarsgård). His journey is riddled with portents of suspicion and doom; those he encounters warm him to turn back - but on he goes until he arrives at the castle and is greeted by his enigmatic host. What he thinks is the contract to seal the deal on the house is anything but, as he is soon tormented in his dreams. Many hundreds of miles away, his wife is also suffering - and that causes his best friend ""Friedrich"" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) to call in ""Dr. Sievers"" (Ralph Ineson) who in turn looks to the scientifically ostracised ""Prof. von Franz"" (Willem Dafoe) for some answers. There are no tangible causes, and the professor quickly concludes that it is evil that's at work and that the continuing and inexplicable absence of her husband, his employer and a recently arrived plague of rats are all part of the supernatural causes of her melancholy. There might be a solution, but that requires an act of supreme sacrifice on the part of the young ""Ellen"", or can her husband and his friends find another way? I'm not really a fan of two-parters, but I think in this case that might have been a better solution for Robert Eggers. We have a brief historical introduction to the Count and to the underlying cause of all of the troubles for ""Ellen"" but for the first hour of the film we don't really develop the characters enough, nor sow the seeds for the mysticism especially well. He relies too heavily on our knowledge of the Galeen story of ""Nosferatu"" (as opposed to the Bram Stoker ""Dracula"" one). I could have done with more depth to that chronology. Once ""Orlok"" is on his voyage and afterwards in the town where his merciless behaviour causes misery and panic, we seem to hit the accelerator and rush to the conclusion as if the cock really were about to crow any minute. There simply isn't time to allow the menace to accumulate. Though the visuals are impressively bleak, most of the acting is remarkably bland. Hoult manages to exude some decent terror now and again, but ATJ is really wooden; it takes too long for Depp to show us what she can bring to this under-exposed character and we just don't see anywhere near enough of the ghoulish ""Orlok"" to understand what this story is essentially all about. It's a gothic, dark, gloomy love story. A story of deceit and betrayal and I wanted more. I wanted to feel a little more invested in the characters: to sympathise, to pity, to fear, even. Perhaps a director's cut is in the offing? It's a great watch on a big screen, but I have to admit to being just a little disappointed.",7.0

**Nosferatu** is a chilling gothic horror with top-tier acting and a beautiful set design. The film uses colour and sound better than any other film I've seen recently, and does an incredible job of setting the scene.

426063,Nosferatu,"Was pretty decent movie with beautiful visuals. I mean the atmosphere was perfect - cold, dark, gloomy winter. Story was good too. Recently we have been getting some decent horror movies about vampires, like ""The Last Voyage of the Demeter"" which was another great vampire movie.",7.0
426063,Nosferatu,"""Nosferatu"" tries far too hard to be something, it could more readily have been, with a lighter touch.  

You can see what they are going for, a creepy noir, horror fantasy. The problem is, it feels obsessively over stylised, to the point of leaden Gothic oppressiveness. Its a quality that infects the characterisations, as well. They feel over stated, too much larger than life (or is that death) and as a a result, at times, farcical. 

The story itself, to those who have read Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", is mostly familiar.  A few amendments have been made to bring it more in line with the original  ""Nosferatu"" directed by F. W. Murnau, way back in 1922. Count Dracula has been replaced by Count Orlock, for example. I did feel the ending (which also departs from the novel) was a ""bit thin"" and somewhat underwhelming.

I will say, in spite of its limitations, I don't hate this film. Its clear a lot of effort and care has been invested into its creation. I think too, certain dramatic and visual aspects of the Gothic film noir approach, are creepily memorable. 

In summary, ""Nosferatu"" is a valiant effort that would have been markedly better with gentler handling. A balance of the dark aspects of the film with a more subtle, lighter approach would have led to a superior final product. 

Ultimately a rather emotionally and visually, cumbersome watch, you might want to spread over a couple of evenings.",7.0
426063,Nosferatu,"Nosferatu (2024) marks the third remake of the original 1922 film, and at this point, you have to wonder, how many times do we need to see this story retold? It’s also part of a ridiculously long list of Dracula-related films, with nearly 95 adaptations floating around. While this version brings fresh cinematography and a chilling atmosphere, it doesn’t reinvent the story in any significant way. The plot follows the familiar beats of Count Orlok’s eerie presence and growing obsession, but it takes its time getting anywhere. The directing leans heavily into gothic horror, which works for setting the mood, but sometimes it feels more focused on aesthetics than storytelling.

Visually, the film is stunning. The cinematography is easily its strongest aspect, with haunting lighting, deep shadows, and eerie textures that create a cold, unsettling world. The acting is another highlight, with Bill Skarsgård delivering a terrifying and tragic performance as Orlok. The rest of the cast holds their own, adding depth to the horror. However, the script is where things get shaky. Some moments shine, but others feel drawn out or unnecessarily stiff, making the film drag in parts. The score does a solid job of building tension, though it doesn’t always hit as hard as it could.

One of the strangest creative choices is the inclusion of an oud and belly dancing in Transylvania during Thomas Hutter’s arrival. The scene is heavily choreographed, with villagers giving him a grand welcome that feels eerie and almost ritualistic. It’s a visually striking moment, but the film never explains its purpose. The oud and dance are Middle Eastern cultural elements, not something tied to Transylvania’s history, and after this elaborate introduction, they are never mentioned again. A single question about it is quickly dismissed, making it feel like the filmmakers threw it in for exoticism without considering whether it made any sense. Nosferatu (2024) is a visually impressive and well-acted film, but its slow pacing, script issues, and odd cultural inaccuracies hold it back. If you’re a fan of classic vampire horror, it’s worth a watch, but it doesn’t do much to stand out from the dozens of Dracula films that came before it.",5.0
426063,Nosferatu,"**_Basically, Robert Eggers’ version of Coppola’s “Bram Stoker’s Dracula”_**

In 1838, a newlywed couple living in a town on Germany’s coast on the Baltic Sea are challenged by the troubling dreams of the wife (Lily-Rose Depp) and the husband’s long business trip to Transylvania (Nicholas Hoult). The excursion to the castle of Count Orlok (Bill Skarsgård) takes an utterly frightening turn, but the worst is yet to come when the Count makes it to his decrepit manor in Wisburg.  

“Nosferatu” (2024) was written & directed by Eggers, who was inspired by Henrik Galeen's screenplay for the 1922 film, as well as Bram Stoker's 1897 novel. There are also bits borrowed from “Suspiria” (1977), ""Castle Freak"" and various possession flicks, like “The Exorcist.”

However, I was most reminded of Coppola’s 1992 version of the story. All the main characters are in both movies, just with different names and the Eastern Europe locale switched from London to the fictional Wisburg, Germany. Instead of Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing you have Willem Dafoe as von Franz; in place of Tom Waits as Renfield, there’s Simon McBurney as Knock; instead of Sadie Frost as Lucy, there’s Emma Corrin as Anna; and so on.

Like Coppola’s movie, the production quality is first-rate. Yet this is way scarier and unsettling and, definitely, the creepiest version of the Dracula I’ve seen on film. But it’s not as lush, sexy or entertaining as “Bram Stoker’s Dracula,” not to mention Frank Langella’s 1979 version and many of the Hammer flicks. While this lacks the infamous love story that Coppola & writer James Hart added to Stoker’s tale, it still has something akin to that with Orlok’s attraction to Mina, um, I mean Ellen (Depp).

It kept my interest for the first half, but started losing it in the second (Coppola’s film had the same issue, just not as much). Yet I liked the ending; and the real European locations are preferred over Coppola’s studio-bound sets (which were top-of-the-line; I just favor real locations).

The film runs 2 hours, 12 minutes, with the Extended Cut running four minutes longer (which is the version I saw). It was shot in the Czech Republic at Barrandov Studios in Prague with location shooting done at Rožmitál pod Třemšínem Castle and Pernštejn Castle, as well as Prague's Invalidovna complex. In addition, some exterior shots were done in Corvin Castle in Romania. 

GRADE: B/B-",7.0
426063,Nosferatu,"Well, it's not woke, so it gets points for not screaming POLITICS! POLITICS! POLITICS! at you at the top of it's lungs.  And honestly, that's enough of a novelty to make it passable. It's so rare these days that when you see a movie that's not about pushing a political message, you sort of like it out of principal.  None of the characters are race-swapped, and the audience is so used to seeing period films set in Europe's past with openly Gay characters and Black leads for established white characters, that seeing people who look like they fit the demographics for the location and time the film was set in is... refreshing.

It's just made to entertain, it tries to keep true, visually, character-wise, to what the source material said, and we need more of that.  We want more of that.

But then, it's not exactly good either.  The pacing is off, I mean it's really off.  It seems to all come too fast to really set in as a story.  It needs to take it's time a bit more.  It needs to let the setting and characters settle more... but unfortunately it doesn't.  It just moves from one beat to the next at lightening speed and, honestly, that sort of kills it on a story perspective.  The plot suffered from it too, the fast pace took away from the establishment, so even the Velma information dumps didn't have time to settle.

I have to give a shout out to Lily-Rose Depp, she did try and sell the character.  She was actually better than Willem Dafoe, who needs a Razzy for this. His performance was a little too silly for a horror movie. It was like he was intent not to play it straight and over-acted a bit too much, so much it wouldn't have even played on the stage. Bill Skarsgård wasn't bad, but again, a little over the top. 

Let's face it, in the 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s this would have been considered bad.  The ratings would have been lower, but it's the 2020s, and the fact that it was just made to tell a story, just made to entertain, made with no lectures, no politics, that redeems it, that sets it apart.  People like it more because it left out the crap that they are tired of having rubbed in their faces every day.  Ultimately, though, there are better movies, better vampire movies, and this one only feels good because, unlike ""The Last Voyage of the Demeter,"" they made a vampire move set in the 19th Century, without adding and overwhelming injection of modern day politics.",5.0
573435,Bad Boys: Ride or Die,"I'd completely forgotten about ""Bad Boys for Life"" (2020) but luckily there are were few flashbacks to remind me that ""Mike"" (Will Smith) had been the target of a son he didn't know about - ""Armando"" (Jacob Scipio) - and that both he and partner ""Marcus"" (Martin Lawrence) risked life and limb to get him behind bars. Well now, a few years later, ""Mike"" has just got married; ""Marcus"" has had a revelatory out-of-body experience and their beloved ""Capt. Howard"" (Joe Pantoliano) has been killed. The authorities become increasingly convinced that he was on the take from the drugs cartels. $20m in your bank account can arouse some suspicions - though the Porsche and beautiful waterside home of ""Mike"" might have too! Anyway, our duo are having none of these scurrilous allegations and decide to investigate. ""Howard"" expected some sort of disaster, so has left the pair some breadcrumbs that lead them to suspect that there is someone close to them who is corrupt. With the body count piling up, they turn to the incarcerated ""Armando"" who thinks he may be able to identify the ringleader. That just makes him a target too - so pretty soon it's a nimble, deadly and quite grumpy triumvirate who are on the trail of the murderers. From now on we have a standard and predicable action adventure with loads of lively pyrotechnics, car stunts and an hungry albino crocodile to accompany some quite witty repartee between the two men who are clearly very much at ease in each other's company. There's a bit of eye candy from Alexander Ludwig and the underused Vanessa Hudgens and the pace of the drama builds to a denouement that works well enough whilst screaming sequel at us loudly. It's nothing at all new, but is an engaging exercise in on-screen charisma and I did quite enjoy it.",7.0
573435,Bad Boys: Ride or Die,"For a fourth outing, <em>'Bad Boys: Ride or Die'</em> still finds a way to produce the goods.

I enjoyed what I watched. The previous installment remains the clear standout of the series comparatively speaking, though I was pleased to see this one still deliver the nessacary entertainment; it's perhaps my second favourite from the franchise. It does have flaws of course, like I'd say it's more serious than humourous and the more sincere stuff doesn't always hit as intended; especially the bits about Howard.

Still, there's enough positive humour in there. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence continue to please in the lead roles, they are a great match. The rest of the cast are all decent enough, Ioan Gruffudd plays what feels like a typical Ioan Gruffudd character well. Jacob Scipio, meanwhile, is pretty solid.

I will say, though, that Rhea Seehorn is underused - she's way too good for these sorta bit part roles! There are also cameo-esque appearances from Tiffany Haddish and DJ Khaled, which sounds bad on paper but, actually, both of their scenes are actually quite amusing!

573435,Bad Boys: Ride or Die,"I didn’t know what to expect going into the fourth installment of one of my favorite buddy cop franchises. Having seen the first movie in theaters at age 13, I grew up with this series and had my doubts about its ability to evolve. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised.

This film was a joy to watch, even though it was missing Theresa Randle, whose absence was felt. Despite this, the filmmakers managed to capture the heart and spirit that fans have come to love. The narrative remains engaging, and seeing these characters return was a real treat.

The film experimented a lot with camera techniques and visual effects. While some of these choices didn’t resonate with me, they reflect a bold attempt to refresh the series. For instance, there are several action sequences that use innovative camera angles and CGI that might feel overdone, but they also add a new layer of excitement. This experimentation is evident in a particularly intense chase scene where the dynamic camera work heightens the tension, even if it occasionally feels a bit disorienting. Definitely A LOT of Neon.

One concern I had from the trailer was the Reba McEntire joke, which seemed lame out of context. However, within the film, it actually pays off in a funny and unexpected way. This moment exemplifies how the film often exceeds expectations, taking seemingly minor elements and turning them into memorable highlights.

The heart of the film and its story align well with what fans love about the franchise. The camaraderie and banter between the leads are as sharp as ever, providing both laughs and heartfelt moments. For example, a scene where the partners reminisce about their first case together brings a touch of nostalgia while reinforcing their enduring bond.

Overall, this fourth installment is a pretty good sequel that honors the legacy of its predecessors while introducing fresh elements. Despite some reservations about the new visual styles, the film’s core strengths—its characters and story—remain intact. If you are a fan of the genre and especially this franchise, you’ll likely find much to enjoy here.

573435,Bad Boys: Ride or Die,"I had an absolute blast watching “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” the fourth installment in the popular buddy comedy / action franchise that started off with a bang way back in 1995. Co-directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, back at the helm after 2020’s “Bad Boys for Life,” pay homage to the “Bad Boys” legacy while injecting new life into it. As a longtime fan, this film actually over delivers. It is everything I wanted and more. I feel like the word-of-mouth on this movie is going to be electric and if audiences decide to show up, it very well could be the movie that saves the summer box office.

When their former Captain and friend Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano) is implicated in a corruption scandal involving a dangerous cartel, Miami police officers Marcus (Martin Lawrence) and Mike (Will Smith) have to work to clear his name. After a series of unexpected events, the partners find themselves on the other end of the law. Now on the run as wanted criminals (and on a hit list of local gangs), Mike and Marcus must stay ahead of the cops and the cartel while rushing to solve the mystery of who wants to frame the late Captain Howard. With danger closing in and not knowing who to trust, the men must rely on their wits, their friendship, and their street-smart instincts to survive.

There is a lot that works well here, starting with a strong story where the stakes are high, the danger feels real, and the villain is formidable. The plot, which isn’t loaded with silly twists and turns, is actually plausible. It’s a rare combination in what could’ve been just another mindless summer blockbuster, and there’s a lot more meat on the bones, narrative-wise. The film also rekindles a love for what I now consider modern iconic characters. Marcus and Mike may be older, but their banter, camaraderie, and comedic timing all still feel relevant. Most of this is due to Smith and Lawrence being a terrific pair, bickering with a natural chemistry that comes across as effortless. You believe these two guys would give their lives for each other, which makes the story even stronger. It is such a pleasure to see these two back together again.

The R-rated action is among the best of the franchise, too, from high-speed chases to intense, bloody shootouts. There are a series of inventive scenes that are expertly choreographed and storyboarded, and it’s been a while since I’ve seen such fresh and original action sequences like the ones here. The creativity sets (and hits) a higher bar, and El Arbi and Fallah’s contemporary directorial approach is stylish, energetic, and results in adrenaline-fueled action scenes that are so well done that the film is a literal heart pounder. This is one of those stand up and cheer type of films that’s best experienced with an audience that’s also fired up to be there.

I absolutely loved everything about “Bad Boys: Ride or Die.” It’s the type of action film that’s done so well, you’ll leave the theater feeling that overwhelming sense of exhilaration that can only be described as a Hollywood high. If you love the genre, make it a priority to go see this one.

573435,Bad Boys: Ride or Die,"I will not deny that I found this movie somewhat entertaining. Maybe even fairly entertaining.

This mostly comes from the action and a few entertaining humorous scenes splattered across the movie.

However, it could have been so much better if the script had not been written by the usual bunch of low IQ Hollywood hacks.

Most of the humor is just unintelligent and cringeworthy. Marcus Burnett is simply nonsensically silly most of the time. His feeding nonsense followed by this ridiculous “I am immortal” crap and rubbish dream scenes were not funny at all but rather dragged down the movie.

The attempt to create drama by making Lowrey have psychotic episodes which ruined the mission and action on several occasions was also totally unnecessary in my opinion.

The bad guy started off really good with the first scenes where the entire plot is set up. Then however, he just became your average Hollywood villain. The initial badass bad guy vibe was never developed.

The script itself is a classical Hollywood action script. That is, it is simple, very predictable, unrealistic with lots of plot holes and really just a rehash of something done a million times.

However, in this context, it was not bad. It was certainly good enough for this type of movie.

573435,Bad Boys: Ride or Die,"**A Villain Without Depth, A Plot Without Weight – Ride or Die Stumbles**

The title of the movie has little to do with the actual plot—a point many have noted before.The story follows Mike Lowry and Marcus Burnett, as they face major life changes. Mike finally settles down and gets married, while Marcus undergoes a temporary health crisis that shifts his outlook on life. Amidst this, a shocking revelation emerges: new evidence suggests their late former boss, Captain Howard, was corrupt and involved with Mexican drug cartels. Unsurprisingly, Mike and Marcus refuse to believe this accusation.

I wasn’t excited about this movie for several reasons, one being my dislike for the previous movie. Since the directors, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, remained the same, I didn’t expect significant improvements. The movie starts off well by avoiding a major flaw from the last one—the jarring shift between serious and comedic tones. Will Smith, despite my overall disappointment with the movie, delivered an energetic performance, and his comedic timing felt genuinely sincere.

However, the story itself is underwhelming and below average. The premise—a beloved former police captain’s reputation being tarnished—lacks depth, and the explanation for his alleged corruption is unconvincing. The plot feels incomplete, and both the beginning and ending are mediocre, which is a significant drawback.

Another issue lies in the villains. The antagonist in this film is poorly written and unconvincing—evil simply for the sake of having a villain, rather than being a well-developed character. This weakens the movie further.

Ultimately, it seems the filmmakers assumed audiences would watch simply because it’s another Bad Boys movie, not because of a compelling story. The characters lack depth, the plot offers nothing new, and no fresh dimensions are added to the franchise.",4.0

As ever, the lengths people will go to to save their pets astonishes me. Danger everywhere and yet both feel the need to risk life and limb for a moggy! Bizarre. It's difficult at the best of times to get much traction from prequels, and Michael Sarnoski doesn't really manage to develop the characters or the story beyond this ninety minutes of stand alone cinema that really has little to do with the other, far better, films from earlier in this strand. It's watchable enough, but nothing remarkable. Pity.",6.0
762441,A Quiet Place: Day One,"Smart horror films are one movie genre of which not nearly enough offerings are produced. These pictures are proof positive that edgy, spooky stories can be successfully made without having to kill off the cast or engage in spectacles of gratuitous gore. The works of filmmakers like Jordan Peele and Alex Garland exemplify this, as do the three releases in this impressive franchise. And this latest entry is, without a doubt, the best of the lot. “Day One” draws upon the mythology introduced in the series’ first two films, but it takes matters in a new, more insightful direction and does so, ironically, by way of a prequel going back to the origin of this gripping, ongoing saga. What separates this film from what preceded it, however, is that it presents yet another story in the franchise but from an entirely new angle, with new characters, a new setting, and a new, more profound, more nuanced focus. Instead of small-town America, where the first two pictures were set, this offering takes place in New York City, showing what happens when the Big Apple is attacked by the now-familiar aliens that hunt by way of sound as the means for finding their prey – and the measures that surviving humans must take to stay silent to keep from being spotted. The narrative principally follows a terminally ill poet (Lupita Nyong’o) living in hospice care who has become resigned to the fate of her impending death but now seeks to stay alive at all costs, most notably in helping a frightened Englishman living in Gotham (Joseph Quinn) and protecting her beloved (and adorable) comfort cat. These circumstances give her a new purpose at a time when she might have otherwise completely given up hope. In telling this story, the film also examines the perils of having to suddenly adjust to a “new normal” under unpredictable conditions, as well as the need for all of us to pull together in a united front in the wake of these trying circumstances. But there’s more to it than that, including metaphorical themes and symbolic imagery that truly make this more than just a horror film (and even more than just a smart horror movie at that). While it’s true the story meanders somewhat at times, it nevertheless presents viewers with a thoughtful tale, punctuated by excellent camera work, a fine soundtrack and a superb, award-worthy performance by Nyong’o. Even if you haven’t seen the two previous films in this series or have much interest in this genre, writer-director Michael Sarnoski’s second feature outing is well worth your time. It’s a smart, smart, smart film that rises far above what one might typically expect from a horror flick – and one that will leave you with a lot more than just a few good scares upon exiting the theater.",8.0
762441,A Quiet Place: Day One,"Nothing special. My first and enduring reaction to A Quiet Place Day One.

Perhaps the biggest shortcoming is rather flat, indifferent, cynical characterisations. ""Everything is shit...."" According to the main character. Perhaps this reflects the New York way of being? Big city rat races and so on? Suffice to say, it doesn't work. 

What made the first two films such a success was a family dynamic with people who were close and cared deeply about each other. You could empathise with them, buy into their plight, when faced with an alien other. 

Beyond this the horror/actions scenes are alright but again, because the vibe is wrong, the film just feels like its going through the motions. Its been done before yes, so whats this film adding to the equation? As far as I can see, very little.

In summary, a nice idea but the overall set up just doesn't work for me. The results ""just another"" horror action flick with a few jump scares to keep you on the edge of your seat and little else.  If you are going to build on a successful franchise you need to look ""hard"" at what made those other films such as success and inject something that is original but also taps into those elements, in a meaningful way.",4.0

""A Quiet Place: Day One stands out for its thematically rich, complex, universal screenplay, resuming the franchise’s exploration of topics such as the fight for survival, humanity, and the will to live, while enriching the saga with inspirational character arcs around mental, physical, and emotional health.

Michael Sarnoski displays his exceptional ability to create an apocalyptic atmosphere filled with suspense and terror at every turn, ensuring high entertainment value throughout the whole runtime. The notable performances by Lupita Nyong’o, Joseph Quinn, and Alex Wolff significantly elevate the movie, with Nyong’o, in particular, delivering a powerful, intense performance that underscores the importance of finding hope and joy amid despair.

The emphasis on the importance of emotional support animals is the cherry on top that makes this installment a valuable, moving addition to the saga.""

762441,A Quiet Place: Day One,"Unexpectedly, quite dull.

<em>'A Quiet Place: Day One'</em> builds some tension well and features very good sound design, though the story and its characters are a disappointment. I have no issues with Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn, they try, but Sam and Eric are written quite boringly. I felt like we were missing some major character development for both.

The plot is rather underwhelming. There is some additional meaning in there admittedly, but it's literally one lame objective and then the standard styled exit. It felt whilst watching that the movie had barely any flesh on its bones. The cat stuff is cute, though the obvious lack of true jeopardy for Frodo even hampers that from hitting for real.

There is at least a pleasing use of Nina Simone's Feeling Good. Overall, however, this left me feeling extremely meh, unfortunately. I am, it is worth noting, someone who doesn't love the original two movies; though I did like the first flick just about enough.",6.0
762441,A Quiet Place: Day One,"Lupita Nyong'o has a talent for elevating every film she's in, and her performance in A Quiet Place: Day One is no exception. Alongside Joseph Quinn, she shines brightly in this third installment of the A Quiet Place franchise. This film breathes much-needed life into the series, which has only improved over time.

The first film introduced an interesting concept but didn’t resonate with me long-term. The second film, though bolstered by terrific performances from Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt, still left me wanting more. A Quiet Place: Day One finally delivers by taking us back to the beginning with a fresh perspective and a change in location that reinvigorates the narrative.

Setting the film in New York City was a brilliant move. The urban backdrop provides a stark contrast to the rural settings of the previous films, adding a new layer of tension and excitement. The urban environment also allows for more complex and dynamic action sequences, which are executed with precision and creativity.

Nyong'o and Quinn’s performances are standout elements. Nyong'o brings depth and intensity to her role, making every scene she's in compelling especially with no dialogue. Her ability to convey fear and determination simultaneously adds significant emotional weight to the film. Quinn complements her perfectly, and their chemistry drives the narrative forward. 

The action sequences are meticulously crafted, with each set piece building tension masterfully. The filmmakers’ use of sound—or the lack thereof—remains a powerful tool, enhancing the horror elements and keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.

Overall, A Quiet Place: Day One is a well-done horror movie that reinvigorates the franchise. The new setting, coupled with strong performances and expertly crafted action sequences, makes this installment the best yet. Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn bring new energy to the series, while the change of location to New York City provides a fresh and thrilling backdrop for the story. This film not only stands out within the series but also within the horror genre as a whole.",7.0
762441,A Quiet Place: Day One,"Today, I visited the cinema to watch the film Quiet Place: Day One, anticipating a thrilling and edge-of-your-seat experience. I must admit, the movie did not disappoint. While it may not be a masterpiece, it was enjoyable and engaging enough to warrant multiple viewings with the potential to discover new details each time.

Lupita Nyong'o delivers a stellar performance as the main character, portraying a patient from a hospice center who must fight for her life. She embodies the role with great skill and authenticity.

As for the main character Eric, portrayed by a British actor whose name I am unsure of, his portrayal lacks a bit in the scare factor. In a post-apocalyptic scenario where survival is key, his constant state of fear teetered on the edge of being unrealistic. Nonetheless, he manages to keep the audience invested in his character's journey.

Surprisingly, the cat in the film garners significant screen time and plays a crucial role in the story alongside Lupita's character. While the cat's lack of typical feline behaviors may be confusing, it adds a unique layer to its character and the overall narrative.

The film's setting in New York adds a touch of realism, with references to pizza that tie into the characters' circumstances. The creatures in the movie, reminiscent of those from Stranger Things, are brought to life through impressive CGI and visual effects that enhance the alien invasion storyline.

A notable aspect of the film is the inclusion of an original character from a previous installment, adding depth and continuity to the narrative.

It is not surprising she is looked upon with total incredulity when other people find out what she is attempting to accomplish in the middle of all this frightening chaos which could possibly signal the end of civilisation as we know it. The film somehow manages to successfully create a well balanced whole which doesn't lapse into a damaging split with Samira and Eric on one side of a rapidly expanding gulf and the attacking creatures on the other side with neither  combining at any point to create a coherent and satisfying whole. The opposite just happens to be true with the two distinct halves beautifully dovetailing into each other  to produce a captivating, exciting, and enjoyable film which is visually sensational and thoroughly worthwhile.",8.0

519182,Despicable Me 4,"It's trash. Don't see it. 

**Full review:** https://bit.ly/Grupid",
519182,Despicable Me 4,"There are so many movies within the Despicable Me franchise that I've lost count of all the storylines in each. While I've never been a big fan of these movies, they at least always felt exciting. However, this fourth installment in the Gru storyline is little more than a dud. The silliness and excitement are there for younger audiences, but the film lacks heart.

One of the main problems with the Despicable Me movies is the tendency to pile on more characters just to add celebrity voices to the cast. This fourth movie is no exception. While the addition of new characters can sometimes breathe fresh life into a franchise, here it feels like a missed opportunity to develop a more heartfelt story. For instance, the introduction of a new, younger female character named Poppy as a heist partner for Gru could have been a chance to add depth. However, it might have been more impactful to see Gru partnering with his oldest daughter, who is now a teenager. This would have added a layer of connection and growth between Gru and his daughter, showcasing his evolving role as a father.

The film also introduces a subplot where some Minions are turned into a superhero team, only to be used in the movie for less than 10 minutes. This subplot feels like a wasted narrative thread that could have added excitement and depth to the story. Additionally, one of the main Minions, Ralph, is stuck on a vending machine for the entirety of the movie, reducing his role to a mere gag. This sidelining of key characters in favor of introducing new ones dilutes the emotional core that could have made the story more engaging. 

While my son enjoyed the movie, which makes sense for his age range, it’s important for these films to also entertain the parents who are watching with their children. The earlier movies in the franchise managed to strike a balance between humor for kids and clever moments for adults. This installment, however, feels more like a series of gags strung together rather than a cohesive story with emotional weight.

If there are more films in the Despicable Me series, I believe it’s time to hang it up. However, if the franchise continues, I will wait for streaming to watch them because I am not interested in seeing them in theaters. The magic that made the original films entertaining for a broad audience seems to have faded, and without a significant shift in storytelling, future installments are likely to feel just as lackluster.",6.0
519182,Despicable Me 4,"If it's not sacrilegious to say, I think this franchise is starting to run out of steam - the plot here isn't very original. The family ""Gru"" have a new child who doesn't much take to his father which only makes matters worse when arch-nemesis ""Maxime Le Mal"" - who is intent on turning everyone into cockroaches - escapes from custody bent on revenge on the man who put him in jail in the first place. Better safe than sorry, ""Silas"" relocates the family to a safe house where they have to pretend to fit in with the vacuous tennis club set, but one of that number - the feisty ""Poppy"" knows the secret and blackmails ""Gru"" into helping her pinch ""Lenny"" the badger from under the eyes of the diminutive ""Principal Übelschlecht"" at his alma mater. This adventure narks the headmistress and when she sees some video of the perpetrators, she's straight on to the phone with ""Maxime"" who hatches a plan to steal the baby and give him wings! The minions - and the newly formed and enhanced ""Super Minions"" - still manage to have some fun here as they discover their new home has a vending machine and an endless supply of popcorn, and there is some wit in the dialogue but the story itself is all pretty derivative and the animation looks a little too tired now. What was ground-breaking looks so much less now and the writing and characterisations are nothing special anymore. It does liven up for the last ten minutes, but the previously innovative and enjoyable mix of menace and mayhem has largely gone.",6.0
519182,Despicable Me 4,"The goofy Minions are on the loose again in “Despicable Me 4,” a lazy sequel that does little more to advance the franchise other than embodying the old adage of “style over substance” to a fault. There is very little here to recommend other than the first class technical achievements (the visuals are stunning, and the direction is better than expected for an animated film), making this installment feel more like a mindless baby sitter rather than a thoughtful exercise in creativity and storytelling.

Former supervillian Gru (voice of Steve Carell) is living the good life with his wife Lucy (voice of Kristen Wiig), his daughters Margo (voice of Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (voice of Dana Gaier), and Agnes (voice of Madison Skyy Polan), and new baby Gru Jr., who proves to be a handful for his daddy. Their peaceful routine is sent into chaos when the evil Maxime Le Mal (voice of Will Ferrell) and his girlfriend Valentina (voice of Sofía Vergara) escape from prison and set their sights on a new nemesis and potential target: Gru. This forces the family to go on the run and assume new identities in the suburbs.

The plot is basic and sounds like it could be a lot of fun with its fish out of water spin. Unfortunately, very little is done with the story. The film bounces back and forth with a lame narrative and cute Minions taking part in a variety of wacky, screwball antics, which may provide a good balance for adults and kids, but nothing about any of it works well. The far too simple and sparse story meanders between uninspired plot points and predictable characters arcs, never quite finding its footing. In other words, the movie is just plain dumb.

The introduction of the Mega Minions is mildly fun and entertaining, but it runs out of steam fast (I fear these characters are going to spin off into what will inevitably be another lackluster film). Everything else is a shallow gimmick as the movie struggles to maintain momentum. At least it’s true to the “Despicable Me” canon, but the film also shows that there’s only so much you can do with these characters and this universe. Move along: there’s nothing original to see here.

“Despicable Me 4” is a lazy movie overall, which is a shame because the technical aspects are so excellent.

One minute we're watching gru back in the AVL capturing another infamous villain thats known gru since high school. Only for him to escape and supposedly hunting gru back down in revenge.. which takes only the whole movie to find him.

No joke, its like waiting for Bart or Vector to go after gru but never finding any result till the last 10 minutes. Its a VERY BORING movie. Yes its for children but the first two films I felt like both adults and kids could enjoy it.

On a side note gru has a kid who can clearly understand english which tells me hes at least 2-3. Yet his adopted children are still the exact same age?

974576,Conclave,"It’s more than a little frustrating when a film seemingly has all of the elements needed to make it work except the one that’s most crucial, the one that enables a production to brilliantly succeed or doom it to failure – the story. Such is the case with director Edward Berger’s latest, the much-anticipated, much-celebrated drama about the convening of a papal conclave to select a new pope. From a technical standpoint, the filmmaker has pulled together everything that should make this an epic picture – a gorgeous production design, stunning and inventive cinematography, and a stellar cast featuring superb performances by the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow and Isabella Rossellini, as well as fine turns by such lesser-known performers (at least to American audiences) as Lucian Msamati and Sergio Castellito. The picture also raises some insightful observations (though a little too infrequently for my tastes) about the current state of the Roman Catholic Church, particularly its foot-dragging on implementing reforms, the incessant high-profile scandals that have rocked the institution, and the rising tide of unflattering public perceptions among its increasingly skeptical practitioners, all of which weigh heavily on the College of Cardinals in determining who should be named as the new Holy Father. Unfortunately, though, the story and script leave a lot to be desired. For starters, much of the film’s opening act moves by at a glacial pace, frequently causing one’s eyelids to become more than a little heavy. As the picture moves into the meat of the story – the conclave itself – it waxes somewhat melodramatic, not unlike a glorified 1980s prime time TV soap opera. Its attempt to come across as an intrigue-laced thriller amounts to more than a succession of backstabbing segments in which the leading candidates to become the next pontiff are systematically eliminated through the revelation of skeletons in their respective closets. Finally, as the movie enters the stretch run, it throws in several twists and turns that either come completely out of left field (and somewhat implausibly at that) or that predictably materialize on cue thanks to the planting of patently obvious clues early on that were wholly impossible to ignore as the story plays out. Regrettably, these narrative foibles undermine all of the other fine attributes that this production has going for it, ultimately amounting to a case of being long on style but a little skimpy on substance, a shortcoming that also plagued Berger’s last feature outing, “All Quiet on the Western Front” (2022). Unlike many others who have been so profoundly moved and thoroughly captivated by this release, perhaps my not having been born and raised Roman Catholic has somehow prevented me from fully appreciating the depth and magnitude accorded to this offering’s contents. But, as someone who seeks to evaluate everything I screen on an equal footing, I can’t help but observe that “Conclave” simply doesn’t measure up when it comes to what it takes to make a genuine big screen epic.",6.0

It's a focused exploration of characters shaped by religious convictions and personal ambitions, offering a fascinating reflection on morality, faith, and power. Edward Berger's technically flawless direction guides a brilliant cast through a narrative that never underestimates the viewer's intelligence. Peter Straughan's screenplay tackles universal themes of corruption and idealism with rare sensitivity, balancing narrative tension with emotional depth.

974576,Conclave,"<em>'Conclave'</em> has a lot to enjoy about it, even if it is slightly overlong.

The performances are its biggest strength, which is an element that is critical to get correct for talky films like this - and thankfully this one does get it right. Ralph Fiennes is terrific, you know what you're going to get from Fiennes and I mean that entirely positively. John Lithgow, Stanley Tucci, Lucian Msamati and Sergio Castellitto merit praise too.

I love the score, while the cinematography is splendid. The story is very watchable, even for someone like me who has zero interest in religion. I will say that the film does last a bit longer than it needs to, I wasn't ever bored or anything close but across the final chunk I was awaiting the end credits.

974576,Conclave,"When the Pope dies, it falls to the Dean of the College of Cardinals, ""Cardinal Lawrence"" (Ralph Fiennes) to organise the conclave that will elect his successor. His own personal preference is for the liberal ""Bellini"" (Stanley Tucci) but there is also plenty of support elsewhere. ""Adeyami"" (Lucian Msamati) could be the first pontiff from Africa; ""Tremblay"" (John Lithgow) is an ambitious American and ""Tedesco"" (Sergio Castellitto) the formidable and ultra-conservative candidate. As they are all assembling, a surprise arrives in the form of the hitherto unknown Cardinal Archbishop of Kabul (Carlos Diehz) and so now, the red tables are set for a process that shines a light on the flawed humanity of many of the men gathered together. For all of their ostensibly benign spirituality, these are politicians and even ""Lawrence"" finds his faith, his patience and his loyalties tested as he becomes aware of a conspiracy. Or is it a series of conspiracies? Is he being manipulated? Is it all just a smokescreen? With the voting showing little sign of breaking a deadlock amongst the 108 men sequestered in the room, he begins to fear that the outside world might conclude that the church is divided. That very same outside world, meantime, is suffering from a spate of terrorist attacks that even the ancient walls of the Vatican cannot shield them from, as the old traditions battle for supremacy with the more modern ones. Not since the ""English Patient"" (1996) have I seen Fiennes deliver like this. His character is a conflicted one, and he portrays that effectively - especially as he wrestles with his own crises of conscience and faith. Those deliberations lead him to a very difficult choice at a denouement that I didn't really love. It came a lot from left field and though quite thought-provoking to an extent, seemed just a bit too contrived to make a point that I felt rather stretched plausibility in what was hitherto quite a compelling thriller. Isabella Rossellini barely features and I thought added little to the drama beyond being a conduit for other, rather undercooked, aspects of the plot to develop. It's a good, solid, thriller that illustrates that politicians in cassocks and red hats are no less ruthless when they play for power, and it is a good watch. Maybe just not a great one.",7.0
974576,Conclave,"Conclave is a film for those willing to immerse themselves fully. It's a slow-burning, almost hypnotic narrative where every word, every pause holds weight. There's no attempt to shock or force drama here. This is a measured, deeply atmospheric experience.

Ralph Fiennes delivers one of the finest performances of his career. His character is like a wall with cracks—you peer into them and sense the storm brewing behind. His restraint is captivating, and when he finally raises his voice, it feels like the rupture of silence itself, as if his inner chaos can no longer be contained. These moments tear through the screen.

Berger crafts an utterly unique atmosphere. The Sistine Chapel, the endless papal corridors, shadowy corners, and striking red-and-black tones transform into active participants in the story. This isn’t just a backdrop—it’s the film’s lifeblood.

Stefan Fontaine’s cinematography breathes life into these walls, slicing through spaces with long takes and obsessive symmetry. Each frame feels like a gallery piece—it’s a joy to watch.

Volker Bertelmann's score beats like the film’s heart, tightening the tension to its limits. His thunderous, almost liturgical chords make each vote feel monumental and decisive.

The most fascinating part: the story unfolds gradually. While the initial monotony of dialogue may seem tedious, the deeper you dive, the more palpable the tension becomes. The intrigue builds, and the details—from the architecture to the character dynamics—form a compelling tapestry of a near-detective political thriller.

But the ending… It leaves you questioning whether the journey was worth it. On one hand, the open-ended conclusion provokes reflection. On the other, it might leave some viewers puzzled or even underwhelmed.

Yet, Conclave is undeniably a film for connoisseurs: profound, meditative, and aesthetically impeccable. It’s not just about Vatican intrigue; it’s a deeply symbolic story of power, faith, and doubt. Berger’s mastery of space, Fiennes’ magnetic presence, and the soul-piercing score come together to create one of the year’s most stylish and powerful films.

""Beetlejuice Beetlejuice captures the original's magic but stumbles over its narrative ambition.

Tim Burton manages to maintain the visual charm and peculiar atmosphere that captivated so many viewers, with the cast fully embodying both new and classic characters. However, the narrative structure, overloaded with characters and subplots, leads to some disenchantment, and the dance sequences don't quite reach the level of its predecessors.

Rating: B-",6.0
917496,Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,"Without revealing any spoilers, I want to share my thoughts on the sequel titled Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.

Originally released in 1988, this sequel maintains the same humorous tone as its predecessor. It offers a blend of cheesy charm and new characters that bring fresh energy to the screen.

The nod to Charles Deetz in the film was both clever and funny, seamlessly incorporating the character despite the actor's passing. The filmmakers managed to pay tribute to the original while staying true to the comedic essence established by Tim Burton in 1988.

Michael Keaton reprises his role as Beetlejuice with impeccable comic timing and character evolution. While he may have put on a few pounds, his performance remains as entertaining as ever. Winona Ryder shines in her lead role, transitioning from her role in ""Stranger Things"" seamlessly.

Jenna Ortega delivers a standout performance, embodying her character with skillful development. Surprisingly, Willem Dafoe's character, whom I initially had reservations about, turned out to be quite comical and well-executed. Bob's appearance in the film is endearing, and his character is sure to win hearts.

Fans will likely be clamoring for Beetlejuice baby toys after watching the film. One minor disappointment was a particular wedding scene that felt overly drawn out and reminiscent of the 1980s era. It could have benefited from some editing to avoid dragging on.

I missed seeing Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis make even a brief cameo in the film, given their absence was noticeable. The digital recreation of the sandworm from 1988 was enjoyable, but the 2024 version lacked the same charm, coming off as cheesy rather than exciting.

The buildup surrounding Dolores, a new character, was intriguing but fell short in the climax, leaving me wishing for a more impactful resolution. Despite this, considering the 35-year gap between the original and the sequel, the film holds up decently.

Overall, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice offered a fun and laughter-filled experience. I recommend watching it in theaters to appreciate its entertainment value. It's a worthy sequel that captures the essence of the original while introducing new elements. So, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!",8.0
917496,Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,"Recapturing the sparks of brilliance that made a movie a screen classic is a tall order to fill, to be sure. It can be difficult to work the same magic a second time, especially if the first effort was so eminently memorable. And, when the sequel in which that second sought-after lightning strike takes 36 years to come into being, the chances of realizing that level of success once more can be even slimmer. So it is with this long-awaited follow-up to director Tim Burton’s 1988 classic horror spoof, “Beetlejuice.” It’s an offering that, despite some flashes of inspired lunacy, significantly pales by comparison. To begin with, the film gets off to an incredibly dull start; it took me almost 45 minutes before I even cracked a smile (though I’ll admit the humor comes along at a more sustained pace from this point onward). Then there’s the picture’s convoluted plot, which has several story threads that could have easily been pared back, if not eliminated entirely (never mind the fact that this offering’s predecessor suffered somewhat from the same problem, though not nearly to the same degree as here). And then there’s the sometimes-disjointed narrative, which could have used some tidying up in spots, particularly when it comes to the inclusion of bits that work but that don’t seem to bear any meaningful correlation to one another. To its credit, however, the picture features the same stellar production design that distinguished the original, smatterings of raucous humor that genuinely echo the first film, and fine performances by its three principals – Michael Keaton, Winona Ryder and Catherine O’Hara – who effectively re-create the iconic characters they portrayed previously. However, many of the new cast members brought on board for this installment (Justin Theroux, Willem Dafoe and Monica Bellucci in particular) add little to the production, serving as disappointing reminders of those who are missing this time around (most notably Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin, Sylvia Sidney and Glenn Shadix). In many regards, I honestly must admit that this release’s shortcomings don’t surprise me that much, as they’re typical of so many of the other lackluster attempts that have been made at reviving numerous classic movies and television series (though I was hoping that a filmmaking talent as gifted as Tim Burton might defy those odds with this offering). It’s undeniable that a small dose of heartwarming nostalgia can be a pleasant tonic for those who could stand to have their spirits lifted a bit, but don’t expect some kind of miracle cure from this one – the medicine needs to be stronger to accomplish that, and this remedy simply isn’t up to it.",6.0
917496,Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,"Well it's 2024, and that means that movies like this get a 10 of 10 even though back in the 90s, 00s, 80s, they would get maybe a 5/10.

The good news is, save a mention of meh, Climate Change it is basically Meh politics free.  There is no lecturing.  It makes no attempt to shame the audience for being male, straight, white, Christian, or Jewish. All it does is try and entertain the viewer... and I appreciate that.

And, honestly, I can see Ortega as Ryder's daughter.  I really can.  I know there's a racial thing going on there but, honestly, personality wise, it was really the perfect casting.  Especially for her daughter in the Beetlejuice world.  It was just spot on casting and though Ortega doesn't do a 1:1 capture of Ryder's attitude in the first movie, she is close enough where I'm primed to believe it.

However... the red pen is your friend.  Bellucci should have ended up on the cutting room floor, you didn't need that plotline.  Dafoe should have been rewritten to exclude the Bellucci line.  The focus should have just been on Ortega and Ryder and the Deetz family again.

It tried to do too much and the result was that you didn't really become invested in any of the plots.

There are plenty of enjoyable enough shenanigans going on as this quickly paced film knits these threads together, but somehow I found it all just a bit too flat. Like an ""Addams Family"" film that's over-written and doesn't feature anything like enough of Keaton or Dafoe and features way too much of Ortega's typically teenage character whom Hades probably wouldn't have wanted. It does rally well at the end with help from a big cake and the dulcet tones Richard Harris - great to hear that with cinema sound again, but aside from a characterful effort from O'Hara this didn't really want me saying his name once let alone thrice.

Michael Keaton remains the best cast member, though Winona Ryder and newcomer Jenna Ortega are not far off. Willem Dafoe doesn't feature much but naturally still manages to be one of movie's strong points. Justin Theroux's character didn't really do anything for me, while Monica Bellucci feels a little underused but perhaps not; what we get from her as Delores is still decent and arguably enough.

Sounds like Tim Burton doesn't want to another sequel, which is probably for the best but if the studio wanted to go behind his back I, I'm afraid, would have to allow it on this occasion strictly for the obvious title possibility.

The visual effects are super, and the pace of the adventure likewise - but the story is just too thin and the arrival of the new characters doesn't really compensate as it rather procedurally, if colourfully, meanders along without really delving into and exploiting the fantastic depths of culture and mythology at it's disposal. The soundtrack is also nowhere near as catchy, and even though some of the lyrics are quite entertaining, the film lacks a killer song for either leading character. Sure, we've the power ballad ""Beyond"" and ""Maui"" gets the quirky ""Can I Get a Chee Chee"", but they lack the charming silliness of Lin Manuel Miranda's efforts from eight years ago. It's all perfectly watchable, and ought to be seen on a big screen to show off the creatively detailed animation, but I reckon it's entirely forgettable and will probably just serve as a stepping stone to the next one which is certain to follow just as seagulls follow fishing boats.",7.0

""Road House keeps the screenplay superficial and formulaic, but the narrative changes and more captivating new characters make the remake a more satisfying watch.

The cast led by a Jake Gyllenhaal in excellent form – in every sense of the word – possesses enviable chemistry, with the surprising highlight falling on Conor McGregor’s debut, infusing the movie with intense, truly crazy energy. The action sequences suffer slightly from some excess stylization but serve their basic purpose.

A more significant focus on character development, especially in the central romance, would have been welcome, but it remains a pleasant home viewing experience.""

Rating: B-",6.0
359410,Road House,"I love this movie. It is a brilliant dissection of ""testosterone movies"" in their most basic form. Typically, these films rely on a formulaic group dynamic to add depth to the stoic hero, as seen in the original. When the hero began to show emotion, another stoic figure was introduced to maintain the balance. In this reimagining, the tables have turned.

The surrounding cast of characters are formulaic stereotypes, including the dastardly villains. This approach cleverly mirrors the original's tactic but with a twist. For example, the antagonists follow the same pattern: once the main antagonist, Brandt, reveals any emotion, it is perceived as weakness, prompting the introduction of a more intense and hyper-masculine antagonist, Knox. This shift highlights the film's commentary on the traditional portrayal of strength and vulnerability.

The protagonist, Dalton, adds unexpected layers to the story. Unlike the typical stoic hero, Dalton displays mental health struggles and other vulnerabilities, making him a more complex and relatable character. He is constantly conflicted and fighting his inner demons, much like Knox, but he strives to control his wild and reckless tendencies. For example, Dalton's struggle with his darker impulses is poignantly depicted in scenes where he battles both external foes and his internal conflicts, showcasing his depth and humanity.

This modern-day Western with a twist offers a fresh perspective on the concepts of heroes and villains. By the end, the film delivers a new message that challenges traditional notions of heroism and villainy. The nuanced portrayal of Dalton's character and his journey towards self-acceptance and control provides a thought-provoking narrative. For instance, the climax where Dalton must confront his own nature and make a crucial decision encapsulates the film's theme of inner strength and redemption.

Overall, this movie stands out for its innovative take on a familiar genre. It successfully deconstructs the typical testosterone-fueled narrative by focusing on the protagonist's vulnerabilities and internal struggles. This fresh approach not only adds depth to the characters but also redefines the genre's conventions. I would love to see more stories told in this manner, offering new perspectives and challenging traditional narratives.",8.0
359410,Road House,"Director Doug Liman’s “Road House” is a wild ride of fightin’, spittin’, cussin’, and bone snappin’, a testosterone-fueled muscle movie that’s perfect for a weekend stream. Taking a more dramatic angle with a drug and crime story, this re-imagining of the 80s cult classic still delivers plenty of action and entertainment, even if it lacks in originality and substance.

Trouble is brewing at a Florida Keys roadhouse, and proprieter Frankie (Jessica Williams) is desperate for some old fashioned law and order. The local police won’t help, so Frankie seeks out ex-UFC fighter Dalton (Jake Gyllenhaal) for the job. Down on his luck, he agrees to take the well paying gig in paradise. When he arrives, Dalton discovers that he’s stepped into a criminal underworld that’s darker and more serious than anticipated. One by one, he outsmarts and out muscles the seemingly endless line of bad guys that stand in his way.

The film works well because of its willingness to embrace its own over-the-top absurdity. Gyllenhaal plays Dalton with an authentic, rugged charm, taking his character seriously, but not overly so. He’s believable as a tough guy for hire who “hurts people for money,” and he lends a pedigree to an otherwise mindless piece of entertainment.

Conor McGregor is a lot of fun in his supporting role as Knox a worthy adversary to Dalton. Insane and unhinged, he feels like a ripoff of the Jason Momoa character Dante in “Fast X,” minus a bit of charm and acting talent.

The movie is over-the-top in a lot of ways, but the one thing that really bugged me is that early on, there’s a casual mention of a killer crocodile. This caused my mind to wander the whole movie, just waiting on the edge of my seat for Dalton to wrassle it (spoiler alert: I was so disappointed).

That’s not to say the movie isn’t corny, because it is. Those little touches of humor, the charismatic lead, brawny action sequences, and nods to classic muscle movies also make it wildly entertaining.

Let me put it this way: “Road House” ends with a clear set-up for a sequel that I wouldn’t necessarily be excited to see, but I’d definitely be first in line to buy a ticket.

845781,Red One,"I thought this came to the cinemas about a month early, but it's still an amiable adventure showcase for Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans. It all starts on Christmas Eve when Santa Clause (J.K. Simmons) is kidnapped from his North Pole home. It's retirement time for his head of security ""Cal"" (Johnson) so he's not best pleased after hundreds of years - and working with ""Zoe"" (Lucy Lui) he has to find out just how his boss's security was compromised in the first place - and then get to the rescuing bit. That search leads them to tech whizz ""Jack"" (Chris Evans) but he hadn't any idea whom his client actually was. After a rocky start, the two men must pull their resources and save Santa before Christmas really does start to deal with all of us on the naughty list. It's got bits of ""Elf"" in it, mingled with some ""Harry Potter"" elements and to be fair to all concerned, they all look like they are having some fun amidst a surfeit of CGI and very tightly choreographed action scenes that mix the modern and the mythological entertainingly enough. Simmons and Liu don't really feature so much and the moral of good vs evil isn't lost in the delivery but it isn't laboured either. Perhaps it's not a movie you will ever remember seeing, but as far as it goes it's a fun vehicle for it's stars to cheer us up as the festivities approach without too much sentiment or cheese.",6.0
845781,Red One,"The star-studded cast, featuring J.K. Simmons, Kiernan Shipka, Chris Evans, and Dwayne Johnson, brings a decent level of chemistry to the screen, which is one of the movie's few strengths. While the actors clearly enjoy playing off each other, the story itself is expectedly generic, relying heavily on predictable holiday tropes. The script fails to inject enough fun to offset its cliché formulas, and despite its festive intentions, the film feels stuck in cruise control, never quite capturing the magic or excitement one might hope for from a Christmas blockbuster.

Technically, RED ONE falters with its visuals. Almost every scene feels confined to a studio setting, and inconsistent VFX work makes it difficult to stay immersed in the story. The action sequences, though admittedly frequent, are mostly dimly lit, which diminishes any potential impact they might have had. None of these set pieces stand out, leaving viewers with little to savor beyond the familiar faces on screen. While it's not as terrible as some have claimed, Jake Kasdan ultimately delivers just another forgettable holiday flick, weighed down by formulaic storytelling and overshadowed - quite literally - by its murky, dark aesthetic.

845781,Red One,"Pretty solid festive fare, this.

<em>'Red One'</em> is perhaps slightly overlong and I didn't sense much chemistry between the cast, though those onscreen still give enjoyable performances and the plot is suitably entertaining whilst giving the necessary Xmas vibes. I was quite impressed with the special effects, I personally thought that side of this flick looked pretty neat.

Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans are fun enough in this. Johnson is a bit more serious than usual and I liked that, while Evans' character ends up being the heart of the movie. J. K. Simmons, more than Johnson, plays against type, it's actually unnerving seeing him portray a true good guy - was almost waiting for him to shout down someone's neck, as per.

Kiernan Shipka is decent, as is Kristofer Hivju - I rate their characters. Lucy Liu is underused, mind. Bonnie Hunt too, I guess. I can't really fault anyone from the cast though, they all do solid work. If I'm honest, I don't see this film having much of a lifespan in the old memory bank but, nevertheless, I'd still classify it as something worth viewing.",7.0

After a key figure is kidnapped from the North Pole city of Myra, the commander of security (Dwayne Johnson) teams-up with a mercenary black-hat hacker (Chris Evans) to locate the victim (JK Simmons). They go to sunny Aruba for answers before entering the creepy lair of Krampus, Santa’s estranged adopted brother. Could the one behind the nefarious plot be the Christmas Witch, Grýla (Kiernan Shipka)?

“Red One” (2024) mixes the Santa Claus mythos with Marvel’s Thor movies for a totally kick-axx Christmas flick. For verification, there’s something similar to the Bifröst Bridge in Myra; Grýla is akin to Hela; there’s the similar technologically advanced flying crafts; trolls, ogres; and so on. 

The creativity scores out of the ballpark with one amusing bit after another, such as the Mythological Creatures Protection Agency (or whatever it’s called), the portals in the backs of toy stores, E.L.F., how Santa is able to make it down small chimneys, etc. Then there’s how the movie effectively appeals to both kids and adults, as well as the kids IN adults.

Kiernan Shipka as the antagonist turned 23 during shooting. I knew when I saw her in “Totally Killer” that she was something special. Lucy Liu is also on hand in a fairly beefy role as the security director of Myra.

It runs 2 hours, 3 minutes, and was shot in Georgia (Atlanta, Savannah and Jekyll Island) and Hawaii (Honolulu and Oahu).

Dialogue lacks wit or charm, with most performances coming across as forced, almost like actors reciting homework. While Chris Evans and Lucy Liu offer the best performances of the bunch, they still don't elevate the movie much. The cinematography, sadly, doesn't help either, with over-reliance on weak CGI and clumsy action sequences that fail to impress.

Despite the aforementioned about those onscreen, I did still like the performances of Daisy Edgar-Jones and Glen Powell - the latter is the best performer, in my opinion.

718821,Twisters,"In the interest of full disclosure, I must confess that this long-delayed sequel to its 1996 blockbuster predecessor is not nearly as awful or hokey as I thought it would be. As a prototypical summertime popcorn movie, director Lee Isaac Chung’s latest hits every item on the checklist of requirements for what such a release should do, and, in that sense, it’s admittedly rather fun – to a point. With that said, however, there’s only so much belief that one can realistically suspend while watching this often-preposterous tale, one that frequently pushes the limits of silliness and credibility. As expected, the tornadoes are the real stars of this picture (and, arguably, justifiably so), while the film’s clichéd, largely monodimensional characters and often-clunky, highly implausible narrative take a dutiful back seat to what clearly (and deservedly) lies front and center. That’s not to say these other elements are completely overshadowed, but their inherently predictable qualities and general lack of imagination fail to set this film apart as something genuinely different, particularly from its precursor. That dearth of innovation is especially apparent, for example, where good ole boy storm chaser Tyler Owens (Glen Powell) is concerned, whose testosterone-soaked persona makes him look more like a reckless, simple-minded yokel than a character to be legitimately taken seriously as someone who might actually know something about cutting-edge meteorology. At the same time, though, by employing these qualities where Powell’s character is concerned, I’d contend that maybe the film should have played them up more, transforming this offering into more of a campy romp, an approach that might have helped to distinguish the picture more than haplessly trying to make it into something to be taken so seriously. In any event, “Twisters” may not be the disaster that it could have been, but, as disaster movies go, it could have been better with a little less predictability, a lot less cliché and considerably more originality.",6.0
718821,Twisters,"A tragedy forces meteorologist ""Kate"" (Daisy Edgar-Jones) back into the office where she spends her days monitoring weather events and advising on whether or not twisters may emerge and issuing any necessary alerts. Another of her erstwhile coleagues, ""Javi"" (Anthony Ramos) shows up with some military-grade technology that can be used to 3-D plot the phenomenon and that gets her back out into the field. That's where she encounters ""Tyler"" (Glen Powell) - he's a ""tornado wrangler"" who uses his guts to drive as close as he can to get great images for his lucrative You Tube channel. Her designs are more altruistic, though. She wants to map the things so she can develop a plan to seed them with super-absorbent polymers that will hopefully stop them in their tracks. A gently competitive scenario now develops between the two, but that is soon changed when she discovers that one of their backers in really in it for the fire-sale value of properties devastated by the sheer power of the twisters, and - of course - the remainder of the plot follows lines way more predicable than that of the whirlwind. It's really more of a whirlwind of another sort that takes over and that's a bit of a shame as it shows up the limitations Powell as an actor. Sure, he's the boy next door you wouldn't kick out of bed for eating Pringles, but here he's about as wooden as a washboard. Edgar-Jones isn't a great deal better and the writing seems uncertain as to whether we are to watch an action-packed adventure film or a cheesy romance with some contrived moralising thrown in for good measure. To be fair, there is an attempt at bringing some science into the story and the visual effects are genuinely exciting to watch as these amazing forces of nature wreak their havoc despite man's best efforts. It's a bit on the long side, but it's still perfectly watchable especially if you can appreciate the visual on a big screen. It's just a bit disappointing.",6.0

718821,Twisters,"Taking the ridiculous to a new level, the disaster spectacle “Twisters” falls short in delivering a compelling story to match its go big or go home premise. Directed by Lee Isaac Chung, the movie plunges viewers into a relentless tornado “outbreak,” setting the stage for a half-baked sequel that’s so stupid, it’s actually a challenge to suspend disbelief.

Former storm chaser Kate (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is haunted by an encounter with a killer tornado while she was in college in Oklahoma. It was a disastrous day, and she continues to live with survivor’s guilt years later. Now living in New York City, she is lured back into the field by her friend Javi (Anthony Ramos) with the promise of testing a groundbreaking new storm tracking and mapping system. The science-minded pair meet the reckless, renegade storm chaser and social media superstar Tyler Owens (Glen Powell), who seems more concerned about getting views and likes rather than contributing anything meaningful. But as the storm season quickly intensifies, there is a scary proliferation of deadly tornadoes that leave nothing but devastation in their path.

Amidst it all, Kate and Tyler find themselves competing to be the first to document each funnel for entirely different reasons. All of this is so dumb. There’s no reason for these people to be racing to get to the tornado first, but Chung tries to create a sense of urgency and drama by pitting them against each other. The plot is straightforward: see tornado, chase tornado, repeat. While this tried-and-true formula offers fleeting thrills, it quickly becomes tedious. There’s only so much humans can do to fight back at killer forces of nature, and there are laughably idiotic scenarios like a character shooting fireworks into the funnel of a tornado just to see if he can.

Most of the film is divided between show-stopping tornado “attacks” and Powell making lovey-dovey eyes at the camera (we get it: he’s good looking)! I suppose there’s no arguing the fact that everyone loves an easy-on-the-eyes tornado wranglin’ hunk, but even his charm can’t carry the movie.

The film’s science is absolutely laughable, with tornadoes depicted as nearly sentient forces capable of reducing buildings to rubble in seconds and sucking humans into the sky while somehow sparing people’s hats.

The special effects, and especially the sound design, are impressive, creating a visceral experience of the storms’ fury. The action sequences may be visually striking, but they lack the originality and impact needed to make them memorable. What’s fun about seeing people’s homes destroyed and lives ruined?

Disaster film fans may be a bit more lenient in unearthing more to enjoy about “Twisters” than I did, because I found it to be big, loud, and dumb. Those attributes can be satisfying if they’re executede well and the story at the core of the movie is good, but this one is not. It’s heavy on the mindless, light on the fun.

718821,Twisters,"I think I need to rewatch the old movie because I cannot remember if it was this ridiculous or not. I see there are two; the one with Bill Paxton that I think I remember and an even older one with muh boi, Crispin Glover that I didn't know exist.

So, what's wrong with this movie? Well, besides killing off Kiernan Shipka in the first 15 minutes, everything, everything is wrong (I'm exaggerating slightly) - I thought I was watching a disaster movie, instead it's a weirdly cobbled together romance movie.

MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD

1. Javi is written as an unintentional antagonist and it's kinda dumb. Furthermore, the issue between Javi and Kate is also never really addressed. They both lost their friends and for all intents and purposes it appears Kate built up walls around herself, left town and never looked back. Both of these characters have had to live with and deal with the loss of their friends but in the scene when Javi snaps at Kate, it's hard not to take Javi's side, and we're meant to take Kate's side because the movie follows Kate. Javi is barely in it. The scene that follows between Tyler and Kate felt like it should've been between Javi and Kate, minus the romance because we don't actually need romance in everything.
2. They went a little too far with ""reckless Tyler"" in those first few scenes where diving Javi and Kate off the road is played for laughs. No one ever brings it up and Javi even pulls the same stunt with Tyler and Kate during the final act. These people are all supposed to be sensible adults.
3. Apart from mini-boss Scott, Javi's team of trained specialists have no personality or character development and are given barely any screen time compared to Tyler's ragtag storm-wrangling group. We're meant to see Tyler's group as cool because ""oh whoa, they actually know something!"" while we never get to know the team of people who could probably blow your mind with their combined knowledge.
4. My biggest issue with this movie is the two ""opposing"" groups. Javi claims to be doing this for science so we can better understand tornadoes so we can help people, and Tyler's here to help people by being social media famous, selling merchandise and giving out food. They both have the same goal, or claim to, and their different tech and methods of storm chasing could compliment each other, so why the unnecessary animosity, especially from Tyler's group, who, if we're being honest, aren't really doing that much. Tyler mentions a supercomputer at one point and I have to wonder what exactly have they been using this supercomputer access for all this time? If these two clowns worked together, they could've successfully scanned a tornado before the events of this movie.

ANYWAY... LET'S GET TO THE JUICY PART OF MY ""REVIEW""!

""Is there political lecturing? No. Is there lecturing about climate change? No. Is there lectures about being Gay? No. Is there lectures about diversity? No. Is there lectures about feminism? No. Does it make a point that all white people are evil? No. Does it make a point that all men are evil? No. Does it make a point that Christianity is evil? No. Does it have a villain that is supposed to be Donald Trump? No.""

What do you suppose Kate's mom was talking about when she mentioned more and more bad weather? Bigots are comically silly, I swear! Swine says they came to watch tornadoes destroy things but somehow missed all the colored people and women on the screen who feel like they take up the majority of the runtime. There's never consistency with these people, is there?

I came to watch a disaster movie and all I left with was the thought that I should've just watched  The Day After Tomorrow (2004) again because at least that movie had compelling people drama. The funnier bit is if you read the recent reviews online on that old Bill Paxton movie, there are quite a few complaining that this new movie is woke and shoving agendas down your throat, so either Swine is being comically sarcastic or they're full of it. Like Tyler, I can't really tell.

Do bigots like it because Kate gets with Tyler at the end instead of Javi? It really does seem this simplistic and silly when simply seeing a colored person on screen usually triggers them into spiraling out of control with calls to ""boycott the woke DEI agenda movie!""",6.0

1064213,Anora,"We’re all familiar with the old adage that, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. It’s a notion that applies not only to what can happen in everyday life, but also to what shows up on the big screen, as the latest feature from writer-director Sean Baker illustrates. This widely acclaimed indie offering follows the misadventures of a Brooklyn lap dancer/sex worker (Mikey Madison) who falls for the insanely rich, self-absorbed, wildly irresponsible son of a Russian oligarch (Mark Eydelshteyn). Together they take the plunge into an edgy, wacked-out fairy tale, a dark storybook romance strung out on steroids, quaaludes and crack. Their whirlwind affair soon lands them in Las Vegas, culminating in a green card wedding that junior’s mobster parents (Darya Ekamasova, Aleksey Serebryakov) want annulled at any cost, even if it means calling on their oily, bumbling posse of cronies and heavies (Karren Karagulian, Vache Tovmasyan, Yura Borisov) to lean on the alleged lovebirds. But achieving that goal ultimately proves more difficult than imagined. As a cross-country chase ensues, a string of frenzied events leaves mom, dad and friends infuriated and the Gothamite Cinderella disillusioned, having erroneously thought she’d truly hit the jackpot this time. From this, one might easily think this premise has a solid foundation for an outrageous, uproarious comedy, but, sadly, the film lives up to its potential only some of the time. To be sure, there is some genuinely hysterical, wonderfully inventive material here, but it only hits the mark about half the time. What’s more, much of the story (especially in the film’s first half) is predictable, almost clichéd, with some bits dragging on needlessly long. Indeed, I’m somewhat mystified as to what all the critical fuss is about, something perhaps best evidenced by the picture’s capture of the Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, the event’s highest honor. I readily admit to being a fan of Baker’s work, having immensely enjoyed his previous efforts “Red Rocket” (2021), “The Florida Project” (2017) and “Tangerine” (2015). But I’m genuinely at a loss to understand the level of praise that’s been lavished on this release. It’s a capable film in a number of respects, but the filmmaker clearly has done better, and those prior offerings make better viewing options in my opinion. Don’t fall for all the hype here, as this really is one of those cases of something being too good to be true.",6.0
1064213,Anora,"""Ani"" (Mikey Madison) works as a private dancer in New York when she is asked by her boss to go look after some visiting Russians. That's when she encounters the young ""Vanya"" (Mark Eydelshteyn). He's pretty drunk, completely stoned and has more money than God. He wants a dance, he wants much more - but that's not allowed in the club, so he invites her to his luxury pad next day for fun. She actually quite likes his youthful exuberance - and his cash - and after a few days, a Russian sable coat, and a trip to Vegas, they find themselves marred. Social media now takes an hand and his oligarch mother hears news that her son has married an hooker. Livid, she instructs her local fixer ""Toros"" (Karren Karagulian) to sort the mess out. He duly sends his two enforcers to the house where all hell promptly breaks loose. ""Garnick"" (Vache Tovmasyan) and ""Tom"" (Anton Bitter) are merely to detain the pair until their boss arrives to insist that marriage is going to be annulled; ""Ani"" is having none of that and ""Vanya"" - well he's just a little bit conflicted and quickly things start to go pear-shaped! This film starts off strongly with an entertaining courtship scenario played out between two actors who really do look like they are enjoying themselves. Eydelshteyn delivers enthusiastically and acrobatically, there's loads of sex and quite witty dialogue that plays nicely on the language barriers. Once the second phase of the film starts, though, it runs out of steam a little. ""Vanya"" doesn't feature so much and the story becomes a little less engaging as the rather too gentle thugs and the increasingly irate girl try to get everyone to the courthouse for the ruling before his angry mother arrives. That leaves us with too much overacting from Karagulian and some increasingly implausible scenarios as the air is gradually let out of the thing and it comes to end rather disappointingly. At it's best, though, the first hour is quickly paced and takes an amiable swipe at the sex trade and the players who make and take from it. Certainly worth a watch, it just hasn't quite the courage of it's initial convictions.",7.0
1064213,Anora,"Anora is a film that starts off strong, pulling you in with an intriguing setup and a well-paced first act. It follows a story that keeps you invested, blending drama with some unexpected humor. The second act stretches a bit longer than needed, but it's clear that was intentional to build atmosphere and let certain themes play out. While the pacing is deliberate, it sometimes feels like it's lingering in places that don't add much depth to the characters. That being said, the buildup is engaging, even if the payoff leaves something to be desired.

Sean Baker's directing is solid, capturing a raw, almost documentary-like feel that makes the film feel real and immersive. He knows how to make everyday settings feel alive and uses long takes effectively. The cinematography complements this, keeping things grounded with natural lighting and handheld shots that add an almost voyeuristic feel to the story. It’s visually well-crafted, even if it doesn’t aim for anything particularly stylized. The way the camera lingers on certain moments adds weight to the film's themes, even when the script doesn’t fully explore them.

Mikey Madison delivers a standout performance, carrying much of the film. She brings a layered energy to the role, making her character feel both confident and vulnerable when needed. The supporting cast does their job well, but the script doesn't give them much depth to work with. That’s one of the film’s weaknesses, while it sets up an interesting premise and characters, it doesn’t fully flesh them out. You get a sense of their motivations, but not much beyond that. The dialogue is sharp in some moments but feels underdeveloped in others, leaving certain interactions feeling a bit hollow.

The score and sound design are subtle, used more for atmosphere than standout moments. The film relies heavily on natural sounds and ambient noise, which works well for its grounded approach. It enhances the realism but doesn't do much to elevate the emotions of the film. 

Overall, Anora is a well-directed and well-acted film that keeps you engaged, but it doesn’t quite stick the landing. If you’re looking for a character-driven story with a raw, unfiltered feel, it’s worth a watch, but don’t expect a big payoff in the end.",7.0
1064213,Anora,"<em>'Anora'</em> is an absolute cracker! The film is unadulterated chaos, I honestly needed the silentness of it ending so I could relax. As usual, I'm not one to judge it on its deep-rooted meaning or whatever, I'll leave that to others, all I can say is that it's a blast and I unequivocally loved it.

Mikey Madison's performance is sensational, quite the showing indeed! Apparently I've seen her in three other things (much less prominent roles, admittedly) before, evidently I don't remember her from those - but safe to say, I won't be forgetting Madison from this at any point. Superb!

Away from the star performer, Mark Eydelshteyn makes the most out of his role. The trio of Karren Karagulian, Vache Tovmasyan and Yura Borisov are great comedic support. I've seen Aleksei Serebryakov here and there down the years and he always plays the same roles, I like him though.

The 139 minutes go by in a flash, with the utterly chaotic nature it is no surprise. It isn't the most difficult movie to predict given that you are waiting for the crap to hit the fan, but how it gets to that point is a wild ride to witness - the concluding scene is stand out, too.

I still have three more of the nominees to watch, but this overtakes <em>'The Substance'</em> as the film that would hypothetically get my vote for Best Picture; not that I take much value from that (or any other) awards ceremony. It'll take some beating!",10.0
1064213,Anora,"I hope it would be nice, it was not, just chaotic vocal 2h fight",3.0
1064213,Anora,"Despite a very rough start, “Anora” ultimately offers a unique and entertaining exploration of the humanity behind sex work and the complexities of love, pain, and trauma. I was so close to giving up on the film during its excruciating opening thirty minutes, which I found dull, grating, and gratuitous. The early part of the movie is laden with an unnecessary and gratuitous parade of explicit scenes and a focus on unlikable characters doing uninteresting things. Now I am thankful that I didn’t storm out of the theater, because the eventual payoff is more than worth the investment.

As I reflect on the film, I’ve come to the realization that the style and tone of the film’s opening half hour might be more intentional than I first thought. Writer and director Sean Baker, known for his ability to capture the lives of marginalized people with empathy and complexity in his previous works “The Florida Project” and “Tangerine,” appears to be making a deliberate statement. The first act, with its emphasis on the superficial, transactional view of sex work, feels almost intentionally alienating, highlighting how society often reduces sex workers to mere objects of desire that exist solely to be used, abused, and discarded. It’s designed to make viewers uncomfortable, mostly because it seems to be a critique of how these people are seen as less than human. Sex workers like Anora are often dismissed as disposable rather than as individuals with depth and feelings.

Once the film transitions into the second act, it gains momentum and its true heartbeat emerges. The focus shifts to Anora (Mikey Madison), a young sex worker from Brooklyn who impulsively marries a powerful Russian oligarch’s playboy son, Ivan (Mark Eydelshteyn). As news of the marriage reaches Russia, it threatens to derail her new life. Ivan’s parents are infuriated and head to New York to have the union annulled. The plot sounds like a simple and goofy romantic comedy, but it becomes more layered as the film progresses.

Baker excels in depicting characters on the fringes of society, and Anora is no exception. She’s flawed, complicated, and completely human in her desire to be happy, safe, and loved. As we get to know the character better, her strength, resilience, and vulnerability shines through. It’s a real testament to how much Baker understands his characters and the environments they inhabit. They are never caricatures but relatable, normal people caught up in difficult, often tragic circumstances. And this, I think, is where the film really succeeds.

It’s a serious story that takes an unexpected turn when a trio of bumbling criminal characters show up, adding some much-needed levity and energy to the film. The comedic angle is strange but also highly entertaining, which provides a nice contrast to the tension-filled dramatic elements. The humor balances the more serious undertones of the story and injects an unexpected freshness into the film, making it easier (and a lot more fun) to invest in Anora’s journey.

What’s really going to have audiences talking is the ending, and it’s the place where the film leaves its most notable mark. I can imagine the final frame will be analyzed and discussed and misunderstood, but it’s one of the most profound, heartbreaking, and touching conclusions I’ve seen this year.

WARNING: I am issuing a spoiler alert for the next paragraph. Please stop reading now if you’ve not yet seen the film.

When Igor (Yura Borisov) and Anora are together in the final act, this isn’t a typical “rescue” or “knight in shining armor” trope that you’d expect to find in a romantic film. Their sad and painful attempt at intimacy is a deeply meaningful and emotional recognition between two people who have been hurt by the world in similar ways. It’s a poignant reminder that love and healing often come from shared experiences of pain, and that empathy can transcend even the most complicated circumstances. It’s just so heartbreaking and sad, and I’m not sure there’s another film that’s so accurately or sensitively conveyed a person’s haunting emotional wounds with such authenticity.

It goes without saying that despite a miserable opening, “Anora” ultimately won me over. This is a flawed but compelling story about a woman reclaiming her agency, confronting the societal labels placed on her, and finding something profoundly human in a world that seeks to strip her of it.

By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS",
1064213,Anora,"Sean Baker's Oscar-winning ""Anora"" presents a peculiar paradox of contemporary cinema: a film celebrated for its supposed boundary-pushing that ultimately offers little beyond its taboo subject matter. At 139 minutes, Baker's tale of a sex worker who briefly marries into Russian wealth before facing brutal rejection stretches a thin premise far beyond its natural breaking point.

Mikey Madison delivers a performance of remarkable depth, finding nuanced humanity in a character that the screenplay itself seems uninterested in fully exploring. Her work transcends the material, suggesting emotional complexities the script merely gestures at. Madison deserves every accolade for creating a compelling person where the screenplay offers only a situation.

The film's moments of genuine comedy provide welcome relief but highlight the fundamental problem: ""Anora"" mistakes setting (sex work) for substance. When compared to Jean-Luc Godard's ""Vivre sa Vie,"" which used prostitution as a lens to examine profound questions of autonomy, capitalism, and gender, Baker's film feels superficial. Godard achieved more philosophical depth in 83 minutes than Baker manages in over two hours.

Contemporary cinema increasingly confuses progressive subject matter with progressive thinking. Merely depicting marginalized experiences without offering fresh insight or formal innovation becomes a hollow exercise. One cannot help but wonder whether ""Anora"" received accolades for what it attempted to say rather than what it actually achieved.

The central narrative - a woman from difficult circumstances discovering she can be loved for herself - is neither original nor developed with particular insight. What might have been a focused, powerful short film instead becomes a meandering feature that suggests profundity without delivering it.

Baker's technical competence is evident, but technical skill alone cannot disguise the absence of a compelling artistic vision. ""Anora"" ultimately represents cinema that has forgotten the difference between depicting life and illuminating it.",5.0
889737,Joker: Folie à Deux,"I was going to go and see the first Joaquin Phoenix outing as the ""Joker"" (2019) to remind my self of who did what to whom, but I didn't have time. I think I am glad because I recall that being so very much better than this. Here, we pick up after ""Fleck"" (Phoenix) has been on his clown-faced slaughtering spree and is in prison supervised by prison officer ""Jackie"" (Brendan Gleeson). His lawyer ""Maryanne"" (Catherine Keener) is trying to have him declared competent to stand trial for his crimes so she can plead some sort of personality disorder defence - he's not ""Fleck"" when he's the ""Joker"" sort of thing. Thing is, he encounters ""Lee"" (Lady Gaga) at a prison sing-a-long and she manages to ingratiate herself with him and then to derail that plan ensuring the plot twists it's way into the courtroom where his conviction for multiple homicides quickly appears as inevitable as there being a song in the film. Now I did like the soundtrack, but by the way Todd Phillips has presented this, it might as well have been either Tony Bennett or Newley who took on the leading role as her part is largely a series of entertainingly photographed music videos with the thinnest slices of meat constituting a weak story in between. It's a love story, I suppose, but that wasn't really what I turned up to see. There's loads of excess, but no menace or jeopardy and the character's previous adeptness at treading the thin line between sanity and madness isn't really developed at all here. He comes across more as a pathetic, emaciated, prisoner whose flame has well and truly gone out. His legal antagonist (Harry Lawtey) looks about eleven years old but that doesn't really matter either as the judicial proceedings themselves offer us little by way of sustaining drama, even as we build to a denouement that offers the tiniest bit of hope then... It's a stunning piece of cinema, money has been spent and there's imagination a-plenty from the production's designers. It's just too much of a jigsaw of a film with too little plot serving as a vehicle for an album boxed-set that's doubtless ready to hit the shops.",6.0

""Joker: Folie à Deux holds immense technical and artistic merit, but it fails to replicate the success and impact of the original.

Todd Phillips’ boldness in turning the film into a musical is admirable, but the execution ends up being incoherent, with abrupt transitions between the dark drama and the musical numbers, resulting in a jarring experience, made even more frustrating by the studio’s embarrassing secrecy about the movie’s format.

While visually impressive and with standout performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, the lack of thematic and character development makes this sequel an ambitious yet ultimately disappointing attempt that adds little to the thought-provoking study presented in 2019.""

Rating: C-",4.0
889737,Joker: Folie à Deux,"Combining movie genres can be tricky business. When the mix is right, the outcome can be truly impressive, but, when it’s off, it can spell cinematic disaster. In the case of this long-awaited sequel to the 2019 box office and critically acclaimed success, unfortunately, the result is closer to the latter than the former. Picking up where the protagonist’s story left off, this saga about charismatic villain Arthur Fleck (a.k.a., the Joker) (Joaquin Phoenix) finds him in prison awaiting trial for his string of heinous crimes. Most of the picture’s first half takes place here, an unlikely venue for Arthur meeting the love of his life, the psychopathic Lee Quinzel (a.k.a., Harley Quinn) (Lady Gaga), who diligently stands by her man when he eventually goes to court, the primary focus of the film’s second half. So, at this point, the picture is already part prison film, part courtroom drama and part dark romance. But, if that weren’t enough, writer-director Todd Phillips draws upon a fourth genre – musicals – to make the mix even more overstuffed (but, hey, if you’ve got a talent like Lady Gaga at your disposal, why not, right?). The result is a convoluted, overlong, often-uninteresting offering that’s heavy on style but weak on substance and not especially interesting. Admittedly, the performances of the two leads and many of the supporting players (Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener and Steve Coogan in particular) are quite good, doing a more than commendable job of making this material look far better than it actually is. In addition, stylistically speaking, the picture is terrific when it comes to its production design, costuming and cinematography. And the soundtrack is great, too, including an array of superbly chosen standards to complement the narrative (even if there are a few too many selections). But these strengths by themselves aren’t enough to make a good picture overall; what’s stuck in between these elements feels more like filler than substance, and that’s where the movie falls apart. In my view, “Joker: Folie à Deux” isn’t as resoundingly awful as many reviewers have made it out to be in light of its artistic and aesthetic accomplishments, but that doesn’t mean this release is not without its share of problems, most notably in the dreadful writing and mishandled film editing. This is one of those pictures where you get to the end and are likely to heave a heavy “Ho hum, so what?” And that’s regrettable, given that the character and this picture’s predecessor both deserved better than what this follow-up has to offer. If you haven’t seen this yet, you might be better off sticking to the picture’s genuinely stellar trailer, as that’s ultimately much better than most of what’s found in this clunky 2:18:00 release.",5.0

889737,Joker: Folie à Deux,"Great title, great movie.

I had heard tiny bits about <em>'Joker: Folie à Deux'</em> falling below expectations since its release, though they weren't substantial enough to know if the film was any good or not. I have to say, I really enjoyed watching it all play out. It admittedly isn't on the same level as the phenomenal predecessor, but that's OK - I wasn't expecting it to be.

I will say that making this a musical of sorts was a bold choice, it wouldn't have been the direction that I would've went with it but to be honest I thought they executed it nicely. I presume that is one reason many didn't like this, as well as possibly the lack of craziness that seemed like it was on the horizon based on the 2019 flick. For me, mind, it all works.

Joaquin Phoenix is as excellent as anticipated in his reprisal as Joker, while Lady Gaga is a neat piece of casting for Lee - obviously her music chops for one, though I do enjoy her acting too. Lee perhaps could've been used more, but what we got is more than sufficient in my opinion. Brendan Gleeson, elsewhere, does well in a more minor role.

Is is slightly overlong? Possibly. Did we need a sequel? Probably not. All I can confirm is that I had a positive time viewing it, so I can't harbour any noteworthy complaints. It's a shame to now read that this film has seemingly bombed in more ways than one. C'est la vie.",9.0

889737,Joker: Folie à Deux,"""Joker: Folie `a Deux"" has a variety of reveries based upon Arthur Fleck and Lee Quinzel, but it isn't long before these elaborately staged musical extravaganzas begin to make the entire film resemble some sort of expensive television show starring the one and only Jaoquin Phoenix and his very special guest Lady Gaga. The film certainly provides a superb showcase for the musical talents of them both, but it comes at a price: It is also responsible for side lining the other necessary elements of the film and as a direct result of this what we are lumbered with is essentially a virtually non-existent story the filmmakers have decided to overload with a plethora of musical numbers and HEY, PRESTO! THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! Well, yes. After a fashion. What is going to happen in the third film it will no doubt be revealed none of this actually happened - which is probably what both audiences and the executives at Warner Bros. are thinking to themselves right this minute, especially in light of the meagre profit this film struggled to scrape together at the box office when compared to the extraordinary success of the original.",5.0
889737,Joker: Folie à Deux,"The second Joker movie had a lot to live up to. There was always an underlying tension, which was expected to erupt into chaos and violence at any time.

Although despised by most of Gotham's citizens, the Joker had a loyal fan-base. Then, later in the movie it gets clearer that those fans were only interested in the monster-part of the joker, but not in his person. When they realized they weren't given the monster, their support and loyalty faded quickly, leaving the Joker alone and devastated.

I think the main idea behind the movie is interesting and engaging, but the execution is way too lengthy. It lacks an action part where the Joker and Harley Quinn drown the city in chaos. The singing scenes were too numerous and his mentally illness may have been expressed better while wrecking the city.

763215,Damsel,"Today I enjoyed: Damsel.

Damsel is a Netflix Original, that was released just a few days ago. Starring a strong cast with Millie Bobby Brown, Robin Wright, Angela Bassett and the voice of Shohreh Aghdashloo it follows the odyssey of Elodie. I am not going to spoil the plot for you, but I bet you can foresee most developments, dear reader.

Overall I have mixed feelings. The story is nothing new, most elements are well known for this kind of movie. Some decisions of characters (including the dragon) feel dumb, and sometimes our main character gets very lucky, so the rest of the plot can happen. The CGI ranges from poor to pretty good, poor more in the begging, with huge landscapes and castles, but later, when the dragon makes an appearance, it looks pretty decent. But I was watching on a rather small screen and Netflix is punishing me with mediocre quality for some time now. So take my visual rating with a grain of salt. Now one thing I will say about the dragon: It has an interesting spin to it. For one thing, half of the time, we do not really see it and only hear Shohreh Aghdashloo's deep, rasping voice, bringing it to life. And when we actually see the dragon, it has a slight horror touch if you will. It looks like a hybrid between your average majestic and broadly loved dragon and something more dark and slimy. A muskrat comes to mind. I liked that (sort of).

One remark towards the title: While it is obviously a play the well known 'Damsel in distress' and obviously Elodie fights instead of needing to be rescued, she screams a lot and actually seems in distress half of the film. Until she suddenly becomes the hero and single-handedly fights the dragon. It is a bit much and hard to believe.

This is in all honesty an average movie. It is neither terrible nor great. If you are in the mood for some imagery, gold and jewels, dragons, princesses, and a few swords, then go for it. There are worse ways to spend roughly 109 minutes. But there are also better ways.

The CGI is good, the costumes and set designs are good, the overall plot is good, but the writing falters often.

The end result is a movie that wastes its star power and the effort of all involved.

VAGUE SPOILERS AHEAD:

1. I get they were trying to do foreshadowing with the opening scene, but it ruined the ""reveal"". The birds were a nice thrilling scene that fell flat by us already being shown the antagonist.
2. The ""V"" hallucination was just too silly. Elodie should have found the _evidance_ and had her own organic ""Tis a lie!"" reaction.
3. It would have been nice to see Elodie wield a sword at some point before they left their kingdom, even if it was just her toting one in her introduction scene ""for wolves"" or some excuse. Take some hints from Brave (2012)'s Merida in the future for crying out loud.
4. Sister's reaction to stepmother's concern felt forced.
5. Stepmother's cut should have been a stab and she should have been in worse shape when she found Elodie. That scene also needed some work to make it less unbelievable. Like perhaps have Elodie make it back to the ship and find stepmother badly injured. Time skips are a thing that happens, y'know?
6. Father's reasons could have been better written. Easily they could've had palace guards shadow him to imply he'd been threatened and then redone his rescue attempt. Why? Because he is never shown to be callous to the needs or feelings of his daughters. Their family being threatened would've made more sense than ""well I thought the sacrifice was worth it for the good of 'OUR' people"". Why they had him say ""my"" is anyone's guess.
7. Less stoic one-liners and less stoic ""No! <*thrusts sword into ground*>"" moments. We've seen it numerous times and it's just utterly boring and contrived at this point.",6.0

""Damsel attempts to deliver a tale of empowerment and adventure within the rich fantasy genre but finds itself entangled in the ropes of predictability and missed opportunities for deeper narrative innovation.

Despite its shortcomings, the film shines through its technical prowess, from visually stunning effects to immersive world-building, and is anchored by Millie Bobby Brown’s compelling lead performance.

While it may not redefine its genre or leave an indelible mark on the history of cinema, it’s a pleasant home viewing with moments of genuine charm and resilience.""

763215,Damsel,"I totally DISAGREE with the first review by thorian93. Yes, it is a simple storyline. Typical if you must say but it is a story that is NOT complicated and hard to understand. The story is not tangled that you need to connect the dots from past, future and the now kind of movie. It's simple but super. CGI is amazing especially the dragon. Eat your heart out thorian93! This is by far the best movie that I've watched this month of March.",8.0
763215,Damsel,"**Movie Review: Damsel (2024)**

**Plot Overview:**
""Damsel"" is a fantasy film that subverts the classic 'damsel in distress' trope. Set in a medieval world, it follows Elodie, played by Millie Bobby Brown, who is tricked into a marriage with a prince only to find out she's to be sacrificed to a dragon as part of a centuries-old pact. The film takes a turn from fairy tale to survival as Elodie uses her wit and resources to escape her fate.

**Themes:**
The film explores themes of self-reliance, empowerment, and the subversion of traditional gender roles. It challenges the narrative of the passive female character, presenting a heroine who is capable and resourceful.

**Character Development:**
Elodie's character arc is central to the film's impact. She evolves from a young woman resigned to her fate to a fierce survivor, fighting not just for herself but for the future of her people. The supporting characters, including the prince and the queen, add depth to the story, each revealing their own motives and complexities.

**Director's Style:**
Juan Carlos Fresnadillo directs with a clear vision, blending action with fantasy elements. His use of contrasting settings – from the snowy village to the opulent royal court – adds to the film's visual appeal.

**Performances:**
Millie Bobby Brown delivers a strong performance, capturing Elodie's transformation convincingly. The supporting cast, including Ray Winstone and Robin Wright, provide solid performances, though Angela Bassett's talent is noted as underused.

**Technical Aspects:**
The film boasts impressive production design and costumes, creating a visually stunning medieval world. However, some reviews criticize the CGI as cheap-looking and the action sequences as repetitive.

**Strengths and Weaknesses:**
Strengths include the film's strong lead performance, innovative plot, and beautiful set pieces. Weaknesses lie in the script and some performances that fail to engage, along with technical aspects that could have been executed better.

**Recommendation:**
""Damsel"" is a film that offers a fresh take on the fantasy genre. While it has its flaws, the film's strengths make it worth watching for those interested in a modern twist on classic fairy tales.

In conclusion, ""Damsel"" is a bold attempt to redefine a genre steeped in tradition. It's a film that will resonate with audiences looking for strong female leads and a story that champions individual agency over destiny. Despite its shortcomings, ""Damsel"" is a commendable addition to the fantasy genre and is recommended for its unique perspective and engaging storyline.",4.0
763215,Damsel,"A disappointment.

<em>'Damsel'</em> has the right ingredients but unfortunately fails to deliver. Millie Bobby Brown leads the cast in alright fashion, her performance in the lead role is serviceable. She is probably the only positive that I hold for this 2024 film sadly.

My main negative is the special effects, which are quite distracting throughout - barely any of it comes across as convincing. The dragon looks OK, but the way it moved sometimes didn't seem right. Speaking of that creature, Shohreh Aghdashloo is a neat piece of casting on paper, though her voice was not the most fitting in actuality. The lighting also felt odd.

On the cast, away from Brown, Robin Wright is very meh in her role, while Angela Bassett feels extremely wasted. There is, at least, a nice end credits song from the ace Lykke Li, ""Ring of Fire"" is admittedly incomparable to ""No Rest for the Wicked"" but it is pretty good all the same!",5.0
763215,Damsel,"Overall this film was just meh.
The cgi was good, but the writing pretty much ruined this film for me, it was just so boring and so predictable.
The dialogue felt very scripted and just did not convince, As others have pointed out as well, [SPOILER] our damsel runs around screaming for the first part of the film and then suddenly turns into a warrior.

763215,Damsel,"Although far from a masterpiece this is a simple, straightforward and entertaining fantasy movie.

The story is predictable to say the least but I do not really care. I rather have a good, solid but predictable story than one filled with the usual illogical twists that the Hollywood hacks are so good at coming up with.

Fantasy is about magic, fantastic creatures and thus about special effects. This movie is pretty solid in that area. The special effects are overall good, not fantastic but good. Occasionally the dragon fire looked a wee bit wonky but overall they were fine.

The movie moves at a decent pace. Not too fast and not too slow. The story and the past is revealed at a rate and in a way that makes things fit together nicely.

The main protagonist is quite right as well. The right amount of panic and cluelessness at the start which gradually turns into a capable and unafraid heroin seeking revenge.

It is also a story with a happy ending which I like. Well not for the evil queen of course but you cannot please everyone.

So, this was a pleasant surprise from Netflix. Their production has been a bit uneven to say the least but I guess the agenda pushers did not get their grubby hands on this one.",8.0
1032823,Trap,"Writer / director M. Night Shyamalan‘s most annoying filmmaking traits are on full display in his latest movie “Trap,” a psychological thriller that initially promises an engaging narrative but ultimately collapses into the void of ridiculous twists and turns. This is far from Shyamalan’s finest hour, and the film rambles and sputters into one of his most unbelievable and absurd revelations yet, one that is so inanely dumb that it’s impossible to suspend disbelief.

The story follows everyday dad Cooper (Josh Hartnett) attending an afternoon concert with his teenage daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue). Lady Raven (Saleka Shyamalan) is the hottest ticket in town, and Cooper splurged on floor tickets to make his little girl happy. Things seem fine until they’re not, and it’s revealed that Cooper is actually a serial killer nicknamed Butcher. Turns out the cops have set up a complex police blockade at the show with the intent on capturing him, and it’s clear he has no way out. Forced to use his wits to evade and escape, Cooper comes up with a series of clever distractions in order to keep his deep, dark secret hidden away from the FBI agent and criminal profiler in charge (Hayley Mills).

The first half of the movie is compelling enough, with a tense atmosphere and a buildup that hints at a plot that could have some sophisticated intricacies. It’s fun to watch how Cooper’s mind works, and it’s uncomfortable once you realize you’re rooting for a serial murderer to escape. This is done reasonably well and is the best part of the movie. The second half, however, derails spectacularly. The story becomes increasingly convoluted and nonsensical, introducing a series of ludicrous twists that undermine any semblance of coherence. This is bad even for Shyamalan.

Hartnett does a great job with his performance and is tasked with playing two men in one. He’s believable as the calm and goofy dad, but also switches to a dark psychopath on a dime. He’s by far the best part of the movie. Of course, while Harnett’s performance is one of the most enjoyable aspects, one of the film’s most glaring flaws is the weak turn from Saleka Shyamalan. I don’t want to pick on her as she is the director’s own daughter, but the forced nepotism reeks here. Saleka can’t act, she’s a mediocre singer and songwriter (a half dozen of her original songs are prominently featured during a majority of the film’s run time), and the movie comes across as being made solely to showcase M. Night’s kid while trying to make her a star. Her performance is as unconvincing as Harnett’s is credible.

With a contrived and nonsensical plot, bad performances, and an illogical twist that will leave you more frustrated than entertained, “Trap” is another disappointing effort from a director who could do so much better.

1032823,Trap,"Quite the nosedive!

I actually enjoyed the opening chunk of <em>'Trap'</em>, everything at the music concert is fairly well done and kept the intrigue alive for me. However, once events leave the arena the movie absolutely bombs its way to the finish. The last portion of the film is terrible viewing, it felt like it just kept going and going and going.

There are plot holes aplenty, nonsensical 'twists' and character decisions/abilities. Cooper, played finely to be fair by Josh Hartnett, is absolutely some sort of big shot in his 'line of work', though makes some dumb mistakes. Though he is apparently capable of teleportation, based on one scene involving a limo.

I'm not someone who needs every inch of a movie to make sense, I can enjoy something that's simply an entertaining watch; even with poorly crafted elements elsewhere in the movie. This, unfortunately, ends up being just bad. That is a shame, because I honestly did like (albeit mildly) the stuff at the venue.

Very surprised to see the fairly good reception this has received so far on a few sites, I would not have predicted that but, hey, what do I know?",6.0
1032823,Trap,"Well the best bits of this are most definitely in the trailers! ""Cooper"" (Josh Hartnett) takes his daughter ""Riley"" (Ariel Donoghue) to see a ""Lady Raven"" (Saleka Shyamalan) concert only to find that when they are in the arena, the feds descend on the place like a ton of bricks and thanks to some secret information obtained from the guy who sells the T-shirts, we discover that it's all an elaborate trap to ensnare the ""Butcher"". As the name suggests, he's a brutal serial-chopper whom they know is at the concert. With the net tightening, we begin realise quickly who the identity of the murderer is and so now have to sit through an increasingly preposterous hundred minutes of cat and mouse with Hayley Mills hoping to catch her man. At times this does generate a bit of menace as he sees the openings to flee being systematically closed in front of him, and with his enthusiastic daughter in tow, his options are increasingly limited but in the end it's all peters out into a rather ridiculous ending that I found rather weak, implausible and disappointingly unoriginal. Hartnett just hasn't the manner to convince as the baddie and there's way too much concert-style material that suggests Miss Shyamalan asked her dad if she could have a film for Christmas. Too long and too feeble, sorry.",6.0
1032823,Trap,"""Trap"" is an intense thriller that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats with its gripping plot and unexpected twists.",
1032823,Trap,"I was hooked by the premise of Trap from the moment I saw the trailer. The idea of a serial killer bringing his daughter to a Taylor Swift-like concert, only for it to be a police trap to capture him, immediately grabbed my attention. I’ve always enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan’s films, particularly when he reveals the twist right from the beginning. With Josh Hartnett in the role of the serial killer, I was eager to see how this intriguing setup would unfold.

The premise of Trap is undeniably captivating, setting up a high-stakes thriller from the outset. The concept of a seemingly innocent concert turning into the backdrop for a police sting operation is both original and suspenseful. 

Josh Hartnett delivers a terrific performance, portraying the serial killer with a chilling mix of charisma and cold calculation. His ability to switch between a doting father and a remorseless killer is unsettling and adds layers to his character. For instance, a scene where he interacts lovingly with his daughter moments before revealing his sinister intentions showcases Hartnett’s range and adds to the film’s tension. His portrayal keeps the audience on edge, wondering how far his character will go and how the situation will unravel.

Trap is a movie that requires some suspension of disbelief, as it occasionally stretches the bounds of plausibility. However, if you allow yourself to get lost in the story, the film is an intense thriller from beginning to end. The pacing is well-handled, with the tension building steadily as the plot unfolds.

That said, the film does have its share of plot holes and moments that strain credibility. There are a few instances where the suspension of disbelief is pushed to its limits, such as the police’s elaborate setup and the killer’s seemingly superhuman ability to evade capture. These elements can be distracting, particularly in the final act, where the film becomes somewhat redundant. The climax, while thrilling, feels repetitive and doesn’t fully capitalize on the strong buildup that precedes it.

Despite these issues, I walked away from Trap having enjoyed it enough to consider watching it again. The film is a fun, intense thriller that keeps you engaged throughout, provided you’re willing to overlook some of its more implausible moments. Josh Hartnett’s performance is a standout, and the film’s unique premise is executed well enough to deliver a satisfying, if not entirely flawless, viewing experience. If you’re a fan of Shyamalan’s work or enjoy thrillers that blend suspense with psychological drama, Trap is worth your time.",7.0
1032823,Trap,"What a ridiculous movie. Cooper spends the entire time behaving in the most bizarre and suspicious way possible, the FBI and every other law enforcement agency have handed operational control (including storming in and tazing a suspect) to a profiler, and he's allowed to escape multiple times by the most breathtaking incompetence on the part of LEOs. Nothing about this movie is believable, the acting is completely OTT, and the plot is barely extant. Do yourself a favour, just buy the soda and popcorn and skip the movie.",1.0
1032823,Trap,"M. Night Shyamalan is a director that I've struggled to appreciate. Despite giving his movies multiple chances, I've found most of them to be lacking in some way. Even films like ""Old"" started strong but fell flat with their endings.

I continue to try to grasp Shyamalan's vision and goals in the cinematic realm, but his tendency towards over-the-top and confusing plots often makes it challenging to enjoy his work. Nevertheless, I decided to give his latest movie, ""Trap,"" a chance and headed to the theater.

In this film, Josh Hartnett delivers a stellar performance that keeps you engaged from start to finish. Overall, I found the movie to be well-executed. However, the biggest flaw lies in Shyamalan's struggle to land a solid ending. Instead of choosing one direction, he incorporates multiple ideas, resulting in a convoluted and confusing conclusion that leaves viewers puzzled about the plot's resolution and twists.

""Trap"" follows this trend, offering multiple endings that make you think the movie could have wrapped up several times over. Despite the extra 20 or 30 minutes of extended runtime, the film manages to remain decent. While it may feel lengthy at times, the overall quality holds up.",7.0
1032823,Trap,"Over the years I'd say my personal opinion of M. Night Shyamalan‘s work, is somewhat mixed. 

Trap however, leaves no room for compromise. In my opinion, its simply poor. Why? Its scripting and associated characterisations, lack depth and intelligence. 

Okay, the idea of a setting an elaborate trap for a serial killer, in a concert, is interesting.Yet, in spite of the fact the main character is apparently a highly successful, if that's the right word, cold and calculating killer, who has, thus far, evaded capture, then why does he behave like a clumsy amateur? 

The ensuing litany of naff moves by our anti hero, combined with ham fisted plot twists and turns, leads to a tale that doesn't ring true or make a lot of rational sense. Suffice to say Trap is a disappointing watch, that quickly squanders any currency, it might have had. 

Its a shame too, as there are definite upsides. Production values are above average, there are no issues with the quality of acting and a credible performance, as the concerts lead singer, is handed in Shyamalan‘s daughter. Its not my kind of music but its clear, she's genuinely talented. 

In summary, strong production values, acting and performances, don't make up for a clumsy, less than subtle script, that left this reviewer  feeling underwhelmed, by this ultimately dull, psychological thriller.",4.0
1032823,Trap,"Did M. make a whole movie just to promote his daughter's music career? Maybe. Do I mind? Not so much. Makes him a better father than Jackie Chan. I take offense to the movie being hilariously bad though.

I'm disappointed because I thought this was a horror movie. The tagline is misleading. It should read ""A father takes his daughter to a concert, only to realize they're at the center of a dark and sinister event."" because his daughter didn't realize anything.

I didn't realise that the main theme of this film was explicit nepotism until I saw that Shamyamalan cast his own daughter as the female lead / singer / star in a somewhat vain attempt to launch or boost her career. But apart from that, this film just does not make sense. At all. Ever. The dude who spills the beans (no spoiler as it's in the trailer) .. I mean .. how on earth does someone have to be that unaware ?? Also, just the actions and words of each character don't ever add up to what they would do or say in a similar (lol) situation. Doesn't anyone ever push back in the writer's room and say ""listen, the character x has just discovered ... and the first thing we've written they do is ...???!"".

Let's just take a tiny moment in the concert. At one point, a guest singer comes up in the middle of the floor on a lift RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR CROWD !

I know movies can take artistic freedoms some times, but when you have among other equally brain dead moments scenes of gunshots in airport bathrooms, inside airplanes and stabbings in the middle of busy airport lobbies and nobody somehow magically notices this nor is at all worried about this or the TSA agent acting all erratically you are acting a bit too much of the viewer. I have to say I did have to laugh at how surreal and stupid the scene is where the lead's girlfriend is talking to him in the middle of a airport lobby and a big old red dot appears smack on her forehead and nobody notices anything.

From start to finish, it’s a series of implausible and downright ridiculous events. The portrayal of airport security in particular is laughably unrealistic. I hardly know where to begin, but here are just a few examples: there’s a gunfire incident in the airport bathroom that somehow goes unnoticed, a TSA officer is stabbed in a public area with no reaction from anyone, and a random guy drives his van around the airport like it’s his personal property. These are just a few of the endless, nonsensical scenes that will leave you shaking your head in disbelief.

To make matters worse, the protagonist makes one frustratingly foolish decision after another, leaving you more annoyed than invested. It’s almost as if the movie is determined to test your patience at every turn.

402431,Wicked,"The film adaptation of Wicked is based on the Broadway musical, which is a loose adaptation of the 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West by Gregory Maguire. Both Maguire’s novel and the musical are expansions of L. Frank Baum’s original The Wizard of Oz novel was published in 1900 and its film adaptation in 1939. The musical is one of the longest-running and financially successful Broadway musicals of all time.

With a screenplay by Winnie Holzman (writer of the book of the Wicked musical) and Dana Fox (Cruella) and directed by Jon M. Chu (Now You See Me 2, Crazy Rich Asians), Wicked begins around the time The Wizard of Oz ends. The Wicked Witch of the West has died and Glinda the Good Witch is breaking the news to Munchkinland. As the munchkins celebrate and burn a giant, Wicker Man-style witch in celebration of the witch’s death, Glinda is asked by one of the munchkins if she knew the witch.

What follows is nearly three hours of how a green-skinned, outcast girl named Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) whose emotions spark wondrous fits of unbelievable magic interacts with the spoiled, entitled, and pink-infatuated Galinda (Ariana Grande) as they enroll in a magic school known as Shiz University.

Visually, Wicked is jaw-dropping and beautiful. All of the talking animals look extraordinary and every sequence with the flying monkeys is a visual highlight. Peter Dinklage voices a goat teacher named Dr. Dillamond and he has one of the most emotional arcs in the film. The bear nurse and dog doctor in the opening moments of the film look so good for what little amount of screen time they have.

Given how many VFX teams are credited in the film, it’s no wonder the CGI looks intricately gorgeous. The three VFX teams with the most credits in Wicked include OPSIS (The Fall Guy, Rescue Rangers), Framestore (Gladiator II, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice), and ILM (Venom: The Last Dance, Alien: Romulus). Then there’s various work from about a dozen different other VFX teams/houses, but the most intriguing one is one called FoyProAI.

FoyProAI doesn’t have an accessible official website, but some digging around on an executive producer’s LinkedIn page gives some background. Foy stands for Fountains of Youth and FoyProAI specializes in de-aging, up-aging, and beauty work in film. They’ve worked on Smile 2, John Woo’s The Killer for Peacock, and 400 shots on Wicked.

There are moments of greatness in Wicked that mostly stem from the chemistry between Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. Grande’s comedic roots, specifically her time and experience on SNL, really come into play here. Grande is essentially the comedic relief as Galinda as her outgoing personality carries most sequences while Erivo has more of a straightforward performance that has more of a dry delivery.

But the generic musical formula is infuriating. Story beats pause and go out of their way to cater to multiple songs at times and it logically hurts your brain. Yes, it’s a musical and yes people are going to sing. But when the main characters are trying to get away on a flying broom as guards are pounding at the door and they spend another ten minutes dancing, crying, and bellowing about their broken friendship it becomes a nuisance. Get on the damn broom and sing on the way to your destination. It doesn’t seem that hard.

Some sequences are thrown in solely because they’ll make a big song more appealing (the whole rotating library straight out of Inception thing) or side stories that don’t go anywhere because two characters need to seem closer than they are (Elphaba and Fiyero’s awkward ten-minute excursion into the forest to free a lion cub). These are both roundabout executions that take the long way to showcase that Fiyero thinks reading is dumb and that he’s actually in love with Elphaba over Galinda.

The film adaptation seems like it’s quite faithful to its source material, but the Hollywood concept of transforming nasty and recognizable villains into sad, relatable characters that the audience roots for is a dumpster fire of a concept. Pure asshole villains can be fantastic too and often make protagonists more interesting if done right.

But the musical fantasy film treats Elphaba like dirt for the first hour and a half. Everyone looks down on her because of the color of her skin. Then when she finally becomes friends with Galinda, she develops a soft spot for mistreated animals. It’s the main reason she turns against The Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) apart from being one of the only characters who can read magic spells.

Wicked is Mean Girls at Hogwarts as everybody sucks and is superficial apart from a character that is supposed to be evil. Elphaba mostly accepts the role of wicked witch because her beliefs don’t match anyone else’s and she’s unwilling to adapt to their ways solely to keep the peace.

Wicked features some unreal VFX and even touches on some incredible ideas from time to time, but the ideas that work seem to stem from capitalizing on a fantasy world that was established over a century ago. As a film, Wicked conjures song after song and drags on and on solely because it’s a bloated musical that wants you to die a rhythmic, sometimes undecipherable, high-pitched death.",2.0

I've been a Wicked fan since 2010. My expectations for this film were extremely high! And I was blown away by how Jon M. Chu was able to bring this story a new life. Everyone involved did an excellent job! The choice to sing live paid off! Not one note was out of tune! Bowen Yang & Bronwyn James were absolutely hilarious as Phannee & Shen Shen. Marissa Bode was fantastic as Nessarose. Can't wait to see her story continue in Part 2. I hope they include ""Wicked Witch of the East"" in the Part 2 Soundtrack. Ethan Slater was great as Boq. I'm excited to see how he becomes the Tin Man in Part 2 because that's not shown on stage. He transforms behind the cabinet but I hope we actually see it in Part 2. Michelle Yeoh was great in every scene as Madam Morrible. She was very Wicked! Jeff Goldblum was amazing as The Wizard! I loved the new version of The Grimmerie! The way it opened was very cool! Jonathan Bailey was incredibly charming as Fiyero! Dancing Through Life was very well choreographed and his singing was great! Loved the way he met Elphaba in this version. I'm very intrigued to see him become The Scarecrow in Part 2. Ariana Grande was absolutely phenomenal as Glinda! She embodied everything about Glinda! Loved her homages to past Glindas in Popular. Her voice was very Angelic. You can tell that she studied a lot for this role. Can't wait to hear her ""I'm Not That Girl (Reprise)"". Cynthia Erivo stole the show as Elphaba Thropp. She poured her heart into this character! I'm so excited to hear ""No Good Deed"" in Part 2! She was incredible! As for the Cameos in One Short Day, Loved seeing Stephen Schwartz as The Guard & Winnie Holtzman as an Emerald City Resident. Love the expansion of the Wizomania show to include Kristin & Idina telling the story of The Grimmerie. Loved that Idina did her Elphie Battle Cry. It didn't take away from Cynthia's at the End. The Film was meant to happen in 2024. Had it come out in 2016 or 2019, I don't think it would've been as well done as it was! I can't wait to see Part 2 and how much of The Wizard of Oz they include. I hope we get to see Dorothy's Face. 10/10 No Notes.",10.0
402431,Wicked,"OK, so I'm going to be swimming against the tide a bit with this, but I didn't love it. We start where the ""Wizard of Oz"" story finishes off, only without the catchy ""Ding Dong the Witch is..."". Instead we get an ensemble dance number that is energetically performed, colourful and expertly choreographed but instantly forgettable. Then we meet ""Galinda"" (Ariana Grande) who arrives in her pink bubble to confirm the news and enjoy the celebrations. Turns out, though, that she and the erstwhile ""Wicked Witch of the West"" were once friends and so back in time we go to the birth of a little green baby who may (or may not) have been conceived within the bounds of happily married wedlock. Scoot on many years more and we discover that said green person - ""Elphaba"" (Cynthia Erivo) is accompanying her wheelchair bound sister ""Nessarose"" (Marissa Bode) to the ""Ozian"" equivalent of ""Hogwarts"" where she encounters the snobbish ""Galinda"" and a fairly comprehensive degree of hostility. Luckily for her, the legendary sorceress ""Madame Morrible"" (Michelle Yeoh) spots some hidden talent in this young woman and soon she is sharing rooms with her new nemesis and finding herself the butt of school jokes. Then enter the mischievous prince ""Fiyero"" (Jonathan Bailey) who tends to treat everyone the same and who's been kicked out of more schools that he can shake a sceptre at. He does, however, manage to create an environment in which everyone can get along and that's when things begin to change for an ""Elphaba"" who is to be made likeable by her now pally roomie. When a letter arrives from the all-powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) summoning her to the ""Emerald City"", then they set off hoping to find answers to all of their questions, only to find that nothing there is as it seems... I have to admit that JB has been a friend of mine for many years, so I ain't going to be saying anything bad about the man who might just be the next ""007"", and both Erivo and Grande do well enough with the set piece musical numbers - especially the lively and cleverly written ""Populer/lar"", but the rest of this just struck me as ""Harry Potter"" goes to the musicals where it meets ""Mean Girls"". Goldblum makes his presence felt, but in the same slightly affected fashion that he aways does, and though the visual effects are all fantastic, somehow they are all just so much more sterile to watch than when you see them within the confines of a theatrical stage - where this works so much better, and without the need for the commercially exploitative part 1 and part 2 released months apart. To be fair, everyone looks like they are enjoying themselves, there's a fun number from Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth and Bailey brings some much needed charm to the proceedings but I'd probably just prefer a director's cut that offered us the whole story in one three hour chunk so we can get that mediocre ""Defying Gravity"" power ballad out of the way (repeatedly) in one fell swoop. It's a very polished production, and maybe the hype has just got to me, but I can't pretend I wasn't disappointed by this. Wilted more than wicked, sorry.",7.0
402431,Wicked,"It’s quite a rare occurrence these days when a much-anticipated film actually lives up to all of its pre-release hype, but this screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical truly does so in every regard. Director Jon M. Chu has brilliantly brought to life the back story behind the lives and relationship of the two witches from the original L. Frank Baum novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and its 1939 classic screen adaptation, as well as Gregory Maguire’s 1995 prequel novel, Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. In this stunningly beautiful and delightful big-screen production, viewers learn how the supposedly evil Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) came to know the purportedly Glinda the Good (Ariana Grande-Butera), sorcery students and college roommates whose relationship initially went through a series of changes from unabashed contempt to solid friendship. However, as high-level political intrigue unfolds in their homeland of the magical land of Oz – efforts clandestinely spearheaded by the supposedly all-powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) and university headmistress Mme. Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) – Elphaba and Glinda become unwittingly caught up in the high-stakes subterfuge playing out around them, a development that jeopardizes the future of their friendship and the stability of Oz itself. The filmmaker thus subtly but effectively presents audiences with a fable on the nature of good and evil, particularly in terms of what actually constitutes wickedness, especially when it’s skillfully veiled. The result is a thoughtful and thoroughly entertaining tale replete with stunning musical numbers, excellent choreography, ample humor, gorgeous cinematography, an inspired production design and superb performances by the four principals, all of whom are certain to be strong awards season candidates (quite a recommendation coming from someone who unapologetically makes no claim to being a fan of musicals). More than that, though, “Wicked” is an insightful treatise on the quest for power and learning how to make judicious use of it, both in personal dealings and in matters of wider consequence, a fitting cautionary tale for our times (or any time, for that matter). If I had any complaint here, it would be my concern that this is yet another example of a story that’s been divided up into two installments, a growing trend that I don’t believe will ultimately serve the movie industry well. According to the director, this was seen as a necessary step to do justice to the source material, given that it would have been nearly impossible to cram everything into one picture without doing major damage to the content. And, to give the filmmaker the benefit of the doubt, perhaps that will ultimately prove true with the release of part 2 in 2025 (but I’ll reserve judgment on that for the time being). In the meantime, though, this first part comes through as promised, and, in this day and age, that’s a cinematic miracle in itself.",10.0
402431,Wicked,"Very good! I enjoyed <em>'Wicked'</em>.

Always impressive when a long run time flashes by - no doubt a sign of a sturdy movie. 2hr 40mins is how long this one lasts, I thought I might have felt that whilst watching but, honestly, I didn't. Since sharing my reviews online I have appreciated musicals much more, to the point that when I learn a film is from this genre it barely registers.

I have never seen the stage musical, in fact the only detail I knew for certain was that it was from the world of <em>'The Wizard of Oz'</em> - which, in turn, I only know from the 1939 and 2013 movies, as well as one or two other flicks. As such, I wasn't actually sure where they were heading with the Wicked Witch of the West - but I approve.

Cynthia Erivo impresses as the aforementioned. I have to say, mind, that Ariana Grande is the person onscreen that stood out most. She does an excellent job at making her character's self-centered quirks so convincing, while also producing a few amusing moments too. Jonathan Bailey and Peter Dinklage are good, while Jeff Goldblum certainly fits his role.

The ending, whilst perfectly fine and pleasing, is possibly a bit rushed/abrupt, though that's to be expected given it's only part one. The same can be said for most films that are split into multiple productions, to be fair. I am intrigued to see where part two goes, bring on this time next year.

The music is, as one would expect, also a positive. Granted I don't think I'll be adding any of the tracks to my playlist, but I still had a pleasant time hearing all the songs come and go - not one sticks out like a sore thumb, so that's good. Elsewhere, visually and plot-wise I have no real complaints.",8.0
402431,Wicked,"https://good.film/guide/haters-will-tell-you-wicked-sucks-heres-why-theyre-wrong

Broadway hits rely on a suspension of disbelief. With the right ingredients, even the oddest of ideas can take flight on stage… but in the delicate translation to screen, they crash-land. Take Cats: something about that core premise of humans playing felines – which theatre audiences lapped up (sorry) for decades – just didn’t work at the movies.

From the outside, it’s easy to paint Wicked with the same brush. Isn’t it all a bit… silly? There’s a blonde Godiva who floats in a bubble. A green woman who was raised by a bear (and whose father may or may not be a wizard). And when they meet at a Hogwarts-style university, we find out their professor, Dr. Dillamond, is a talking goat. These aren’t exactly the trappings of a thoughtful, award-winning piece of drama. But peel back the colours of any GOOD fantasy and you’ll usually find the allegories are rich and meaningful. With its themes of parental guilt, absent fatherhood, disability, discrimination and class supremacy, Wicked is no exception.

Look, we’re not saying Wicked’s perfect. At 2 hours 40 minutes, it’s knocking HARD on the “too long, wrap it up!” door. And there’s characters that either overdo it a bit (Governor Thropp) or arguably, don’t add much at all (oh Pfannee, do you even go to this school?).

But that’s a bit like complaining about a scratch on a speedboat. A sleek, wondrous craft that can whiz you somewhere thrilling, and change you along the way. We didn’t have crazy high expectations – hey, the everyday moviegoer isn’t a hardcore Broadway fan – but honestly? You don’t need to be. Wicked is a movie for anyone. And maybe that’s why it feels so GOOD.",

""Despite a few technical and narrative missteps, Wicked shines brightly with its compelling story, outstanding performances, and astonishing musical sequences.

Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande-Butera deliver truly remarkable, award-worthy performances, grounding the film with unparalleled chemistry and elevating their characters to incredible heights, all while demonstrating phenomenal vocal talent. Jon M. Chu crafts an ambitious, visually stunning adaptation that captivates both long-time fans of the musical and newcomers alike.

With timeless messages conveyed through poignant themes and well-crafted character arcs, Wicked not only lives up to its initial hype but leaves audiences eagerly awaiting the next chapter of this magical story.""

Rating: A-",8.0
402431,Wicked,"I so wanted to hate it.

I didn't like the decision to split the musical into two films. I didn't like the casting. I HATED the trailer, where it made the film look like it was baked with plastic, glossy CGI, or even worse Gen-AI.

And I was wrong.

Erivo and Grande are stellar. The co-stars aren't who I'd have picked, but they're quite excellent themselves. (Particularly the folks playing Bok and Nessa.) 

It's a glorious, beautiful, and joyful film in many ways. When Elphaba finally soars, my heart soared as well and I found myself tearing up. 

I also appreciated how it gives a nod to the much, much darker book, especially with the propaganda posters and effigy in the opening, and the various references to Oz's takeover. (Like when the stone edifice falls off the side of the school building revealing the animals beneath.)

My only complaint is, as with any two or three-parter, lots of the filler is garbage. This is especially true  of the Dancing Through Life number, which becomes unbearably long and significantly less magical because of the added content. 

Still, highly recommended. 8/10 Stars.",8.0
402431,Wicked,"Wicked by Jon M. Chu is an ambitious adaptation that largely delivers on its promise to bring the magic of the beloved musical to the big screen. Visually, the movie is stunning, with vibrant set pieces and a cinematic take on Oz that feels both familiar and fresh. Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba brings an emotional depth that truly captures the character’s struggles, while Ariana Grande’s Glinda adds a balance of charm and humor. Together, their performances anchor the film and make the story’s core themes, friendship, identity, and societal perception, shine.

The musical numbers are undeniably the movie’s highlight. Songs like ""Defying Gravity"" are powerful and beautifully staged, though I couldn’t help but feel the choreography, while good, could have been taken a step further to truly elevate the experience. The pacing is a mixed bag, with the first act taking its time to set the stage, which may feel slow for some. That said, once the story finds its rhythm, it balances the emotional beats with grandeur fairly well, though the shifts in tone could have been smoothed out more.

Overall, Wicked succeeds as a visually impressive and emotionally resonant adaptation, even if it stumbles in a few places. It’s a solid film for fans of the musical and newcomers alike. While there’s room for improvement, particularly in pacing and choreography, it’s hard to deny that the performances and visual storytelling make it a worthwhile watch.",7.0
762509,Mufasa: The Lion King,"Rubbish poster aside, <em>'Mufasa: The Lion King'</em> is a success.

I can't overlook that poster, how amateur can you get - it genuinely looks like something I'd whip up seconds before the deadline. Thankfully, the movie itself is very good, it's one I enjoyed quite a bit. The animation is class, the lions look amazingly majestic. I will say the white ones look a bit iffy, but that's nothing even close to a big issue.

The voice cast are all perfectly good. Aaron Pierre, Kelvin Harrison Jr. (only now realising his character wasn't called Tucker... bit embarrassing on my part), John Kani et al. all merit props. The standouts for me, however, are Mads Mikkelsen and Lennie James - two actors I do love watching (or listening to, in this case), admittedly.

Music-wise, it's not the strongest - I can't recall any of the songs, to be honest. That's not actually a terrible thing though, as it means none of the musical numbers grated on me either - and that's always a win in my books. Elsewhere, Timon & Pumbaa are unamusing and wasted, but at the same time are unnecessarily forced into this prequel/sequel.

Obviously, this still falls far adrift of the beloved original animated film. Nevertheless, I'll hold it in higher esteem than the 2019 remake, even if I didn't overly mind that one to be fair. Oh, lastly, nice touch dedicating this to James Earl Jones at the get-go - was expecting it at the end.",8.0
762509,Mufasa: The Lion King,"They've been praying for rain for ages but are ill-prepared for when it finally comes and washes away the young ""Mufasa"" from the loving paws of his parents and out into the wilderness. Luckily, he is rescued by the friendly young cub ""Taka"" whose mother ""Eshe"" convinces his sceptical father ""Obasi"" to let her adopt him. The pair prove inseparable as they grow up, but the encroachment of a pride of angry white lions led by ""Kiros"" soon threatens their peaceful lives and forces the two to flee in search of a mystical land. Along the way they encounter the wily lioness ""Sarabi"" and her airborne early warning system ""Zazu"" and joining forces, have their work cut out for them crossing the snowy mountains. The whole story is regaled by the sagely ""Rafiki"" to a young cub ""Kiara"" and the underused, rough-round-the-edges, warthog/meerkat combo of ""Pumbaa"" and ""Timon"" so we know the ending all along. Not that jeopardy is in anyway the point here, it's not that kind of Disney film. It's really just a fairly shameless rip-off of the first, far superior, film that though it looks great with all the integrated live-action visuals has a story that's cheesily wafer thin. It's purpose is to set out the origins of the ""Lion King"" (1994) but all it really does is remind us of just how good that was and just how average this one is. They keep referring to the ""Circle of Life"" but barring a few meanderings from the orchestral score into the songs from the past, we are simply left with some banal offerings from Lin-Manuel Miranda best summed up by ""Bye Bye"" - straight from the Janet and John book of rhyming ""seas"" with ""trees"". Certainly, it looks great but it's also quite confusing whom it's for. The kids watching in the cinema with me were quickly bored by the undercooked story once the awe of the visuals had worn off. It's all perfectly watchable and is quite a testament to the arts of those in the CGI department well worthy of the big screen, but it's all instantly forgettable fayre that just sort of rolls along towards it's rousing denouement unremarkably.",6.0

""Challengers transcends the limits of its tennis-centric premise to delve deep into the complexities of human relationships and personal desires.

Luca Guadagnino’s meticulous filmmaking and metaphoric storytelling, coupled with the stellar, fervorous performances of Zendaya, Josh O’Connor, and Mike Faist, propel viewers into a world where the lines between love and competition blur with tantalizing intensity, sexual tension, and an electrifying score.

With its potent blend of passion, intimacy, narrative and character depth, the film never stops reminding us that the most captivating stories lie beyond the boundaries of the tennis court.""

Rating: A-",8.0
937287,Challengers,"A lot of fun, is <em>'Challengers'</em>.

First of all, I gotta say, the proper poster is so good! Thankfully, the movie matches. I enjoyed my time watching this one, I do have some (very) minor issues with the pacing and music (that blaring club track is a bit much) but in truth they evaporate given how high quality the rest of the film is.

The cast are great. Zendaya is the obvious star of the 131 minutes, she is top notch throughout. Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist are just as impressive though, they more than hold their own alongside Zendaya. I've seen O’Connor before in TV's <em>'The Crown'</em> so I'm not all that surprised or anything, though this is the first time I've see Faist act.

Aside from the earlier noted track, the music is overall excellent though. I also like how the tennis is portrayed, I'm only a casual viewer of the sport but it all felt believable in that regard. I think the run time could've been trimmed a tad, while the amount of different timelines is perhaps a little excessive. Again, mind, these are not major concerns of mine, just worthy of noting.

A terrific flick, no doubt!",9.0
937287,Challengers,"Tennis playing ""Art"" (Mike Faist) and ""Patrick"" (Josh C'Connor) have been best mates since school but there's a fly in the ointment of their bromance. That's the upcoming superstar that is ""Tashi"" (Zendaya) - whom both of the boys take a shine to. A shared beer in their hotel room and she declares she's no home wrecker - but as this story progresses we arrive at a scenario that sees her own career aspirations tragically thwarted and rather vicariously transferred onto now husband ""Art"" whilst her ex-boyfriend ""Patrick"" and he now barely speak. Having won six slams, ""Art"" is running out of steam - but his unfulfilled wife is not ready for him to quit. Can he win an elusive US Open? For that matter, can he even win a confidence-building Challenger event in which he must beat his former friend. It's this match that serves as the conduit for the story as we dance about the timelines delivering a story that I felt was rife with pretty toxic ambition. Zendaya handles her really ambiguous, sometimes quite cruel and selfish, role here real quite unnervingly well as Luca Guadagnino allows all three actors to develop characteristics that vary from the engaging to the detestable - and he lets us be the judge. They are all flawed individuals spurned on by hormones, desire and the highly charged and competitive nature of their touring existences makes for quite a compelling look at just what makes these guys tick! After his appearance in ""Mothering Sunday"" (2021) O'Connor has no issues getting naked, the others prove a little more restrained as the sexual chemistry becomes more palpable and destructive and by the denouement - well who knows what will happen? I like that uncertainty - and I know what I wanted to occur... If you can't like yourself, can anyone else?",7.0
937287,Challengers,"While I have found Zendaya to be an attractive and stylish young woman, I haven't really warmed up to her as a serious actress all that much. She was fine in the ""Spider-Man"" franchise since it didn't require any great stretches for her. I feel that in the ""Dune"" series she is overshadowed by other, more talented actors. And in the more serious ""Malcolm and Marie"" she was in over her head in the cheap imitation of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""

""Challengers"" is a big step for her as an actress. And while I do still feel as though her two co-stars were more convincing, I think that this part is a brave move into meatier and more challenging roles.

The film is told over a thirteen year period. Zendaya plays Tashi a rising star in the tennis world. She seems to be the next great thing. At one of the tournaments she meets Art and Patrick, played by Mike Faist and Josh O'Connor. They are also competitive tennis players and best friends. And they both fall for Tashi. Who wouldn't?

Over the next several years they each start a relationship with Tashi. Not surprisingly they grow apart, but their stories continue to intersect as they both move closer to an inevitable confrontation...both off and on the court.

It's the kind of movie that Hollywood rarely makes anymore. It's about people and their feelings, and their ambitions. It's not a sequel or a remake, or comic book. This is why I find stories about real human emotions to be so much more exciting than the latest, generic action retread. The plot is advanced by the things the characters say and how their emotions guide their futures.

The film offers ambiguous motivations. On the surface we see them caring for each other, but what lies deep beneath is a much more selfish reality that put them in a survival mode. Each of them is a well written being. There is no hero to the story...nor a villain.

While Zendaya holds her own, Faist and O'Connor are the best part. They move the story and are also the central interest to me. This is, after all a love story, but we don't really understand early that it is also an unconventional one between the two male characters as well. All three of them hold a certain amount of sexual tension between them.

If I was to have a small gripe, it would be that the last twenty minutes is stretched too long. I'm glad that the filmmakers didn't rush it like many films do, but...they do milk the final in too many slow motion and trick shots. It adds tension, but it gets close to making us lose a bit of interest as well. Just get on with it!",9.0
937287,Challengers,"A story about a sociopathic, egocentric, racist narcissist who - not knowing what love is - treats two young men who both fall in love with her as pawns in a twisted game of life.

The havoc she wreaks, and the lives she break, are of no concern to her, as she continues on and on trying to satisfy her quench for power, control, and admiration.

It's not that I necessarily have a problem with films spun around an antagonist, or with demonic female characters, there's just something about the way it is on display in this film that makes me nauseous and tired. Perhaps it's the poor writing, or the lack of any real protagonist, as the two who are supposedly our protagonists are really willing victims, so it's hard to feel for them. Maybe it's the disorganized structure of the script. And pairing it with an atrocius score certainly doesn't help. 

Oh, and the supposed ""tennis"" they're playing is so far detached from actual tennis that you can't help but laugh out loud at times when the film is trying to be very dramatic. Quite unfortunate.

937287,Challengers,"Challengers presents an intriguing story centered around an unconventional love triangle with a twist. The film is well-crafted, showcasing impressive performances, direction, editing and cinematography.

The plot of Challengers revolves around the complex relationships between the three main characters, exploring themes of love, rivalry, and redemption. The story is engaging, with a narrative that keeps the audience invested in the characters' journeys. 

Mike Faist and Josh O'Connor deliver solid performances as Art and Patrick, two friends whose relationship becomes strained. Their chemistry feels authentic, adding to the film's emotional weight. 

However, Zendaya's performance as Tashi is the film's standout element. She commands every scene she is in, bringing depth and nuance to her character. Her portrayal of Tashi's internal conflicts and external manipulations is both compelling and believable. 

The film's technical aspects are equally impressive. The cinematography beautifully captures the film's mood, using lighting and framing to enhance the emotional impact of the scenes especially on the court. The editing is top-notch, ensuring a smooth narrative flow and maintaining the film's pacing. The seamless transitions between past and present help to build suspense and deepen the story.

Challengers is particularly appealing to younger generations and aspiring filmmakers. Its fresh take on a classic trope, combined with high-quality filmmaking, makes it a standout in contemporary cinema. The film's exploration of modern relationships and personal growth resonates well with a younger audience. Additionally, its artistic approach provides inspiration for filmmakers looking to push the boundaries of traditional storytelling.

937287,Challengers,"A Game of Love, Rivalry, and Resilience

The Challengers, directed by Luca Guadagnino, serves up more than just a tennis love triangle—it’s a story about passion, ambition, and the lengths we go to reclaim our sense of self. Zendaya shines as Tashi Duncan, a once-dominant tennis star turned coach, whose life is as complex and intense as the sport she mastered.

This film takes the audience on a whirlwind of emotions, following Tashi’s journey as she navigates a challenging personal and professional dynamic between her husband, Art, and her ex-boyfriend, Patrick. What starts as a sports drama quickly evolves into a tale of love, loyalty, and the complicated ties that bind us. Guadagnino’s direction brings the tension of a tennis match to every scene, where every glance, word, and play feels like a volley in an emotional game that none of the characters are fully prepared for.

At the heart of The Challengers is a powerful message about resilience and the relentless pursuit of purpose. Tashi’s return to the court—albeit from the sidelines as a coach—is emblematic of her unwillingness to give up, even when her own dreams seem beyond reach. She embodies the law of assumption, believing in the possibilities that lie ahead, even when the present seems tangled in a web of broken relationships and lost potential. By daring to assume victory, not only in the game but in her own life, Tashi embraces a future filled with the abundance of second chances.

What makes this film so compelling is the complexity of its characters, all of whom are struggling with their own vulnerabilities. The tennis matches are metaphors for life’s battles—hard-fought, full of unpredictable twists, and always demanding more than expected. It’s in the emotional back-and-forth, the moments of doubt and the sparks of hope, that The Challengers truly comes alive.

Ultimately, The Challengers is about the fight to reclaim one’s identity and the power of belief—belief in love, in oneself, and in the idea that we are always capable of bouncing back from life’s toughest setbacks. It’s an inspiring, beautifully crafted film that reminds us, whether on the court or off, that every challenge we face is an opportunity to grow stronger.

If you’re looking for a story that blends high-stakes competition with profound personal growth, The Challengers is a must-watch. It serves up drama, passion, and the belief that, no matter the odds, we always have the strength to rise.",

A trip on a train to a funeral proves decisive as three of the other passengers also feature in her dreams - all being the targets of a mysterious lycra-clad tunnel-climber bent on slaughter. Can she rescue them and find out just what's going on? Well possibly, but the story is just thin and the characters so undercooked that I didn't really care. The whole arachnid story line is under-developed to the point that I couldn't see what her skills really had to do with a spider at all. Tahar Rahim seemed uncertain if he was supposed to be ""Deadpool"" and/or Antonio Banderas and hats have to come off to Celeste O'Connor for playing the entirely obnoxious and attitudinal ""Mattie"" with quite such aplomb. The denouement is straight out of ""Highlander"" (1986) and I'm afraid that rather summed this up. Not an original bone in it's small and squidgy body, over-scripted and made for the sake of it. Sure, it's all about team bonding, trust and finding yourself (quite literally), but the readiness with which all concerned buy into this increasingly repetitive and whacky scenario is just daft. Like the whole multi-verse concept, the studios have decided to take super-hero films and flog them to death without worrying about concept, character or a decent story, and though Johnson does try to lift this where she can, it's ends up being something akin to one of those ""Superman"" television episodes we used to watch with Dean Cain - only with monotonous time-shifting!",5.0
634492,Madame Web,"Ouch, that average rating! I'm not going to lie though, I genuinely had a fun time watching <em>'Madame Web'</em>... perhaps I should be keeping that fact quiet?

I don't know what to say, I found it to be suitably entertaining. I'm sure there are plot holes aplenty (I noticed a few) and it probably makes zero sense/isn't a good adaptation compared to its source material or whatever but honesty... I don't care, it gave me enough enjoyment that I wasn't questioning anything about what I was watching.

The cast are probably the key factors as to why I did enjoy this. I previously knew of Dakota Johnson but hadn't actually seen her in anything properly, I found her performance to be more than noteworthy and she spearheads the film strongly. The trio of Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor are positives too.

Tahar Rahim's antagonist, meanwhile, is poorly written and portrayed, though I personally thought the actor did a good job. I have no complaints with anyone who appears onscreen to be honest. Away from them, the pacing and score are also standouts.

In my recollection of viewing this, I truthfully haven't got any issues with it. If it wasn't for the slight bad murmurs that I did hear about pre-watch (though not much of it as I avoid as much as I can with movies) and the reaction on sites like this post-watch, I'd not be questioning my thoughts about this whatsoever.

As I always say, to each their own. For me, gimme a sequel (as long as the cast remain, mind). Not even sorry.",8.0

634492,Madame Web,"Perhaps it was the perceived and preconceived notion that I had of this film being really bad as shown by its ratings scores from various sites, but I found this film actually really funny in a campy sort of way and better than decent in terms of not-big-budget superhero-film sort of way. In short, I came away enjoying it and unhappy with how this movie was portrayed in the movie-review media. I think it was just a piling on of the mob-mentality reviewers who tried to kick somebody who was already down, but anyway, I do hope this gets a sequel and I do hope the filmmakers continue with the campy, unintentionally funny, very quiet scenes with no theme music whatsoever style, low-budget-but-still-decent CGI, and over-all enjoyable moviemaking which can be watched and enjoyed for an hour and a half. A huge departure from those 3-hour self-important cinematic ""spectacles"" of today.",
634492,Madame Web,"Is Madame Web the worst superhero movie ever made? Not by a longshot as Superman IV, Batman & Robin and Supergirl would take a front seat in that department. Now the argument can be made it's the worst in the modern era of superhero movies, though personally it's ""better"" than Suicide Squad but even that one had costumed heroes in it versus MW which only had maybe a few minutes of the ladies in their costumes and even then, it's via future visions.

Beyond that, nothing really works. The direction, even with the twisty-turny camera movements felt familiar as I'm pretty sure I've seen it done before but minimally. The performances from everyone was either bland, Dakota Johnson especially, or downright awful (Tahar Rahim), not helped by the stilted and oft atrocious dialogue from no less than four writers, two of which were responsible for Morbius.

I didn't hate Madame Web more so that I found it downright dull and boring. There's no reason to watch this and with the terrible box office, the last line of ""And you know the best thing about the future? It hasn't happened yet"" is pretty poignant. **2.0/5**",4.0

634492,Madame Web,"Watching this film, I couldn't shake the feeling that the script was written by AI. The story, themes, and dialogue all feel utterly soulless. The lifeless acting only compounds the problem, making the entire experience miserable.

The story lacks any genuine emotion or creativity. It's as if the writers followed a formula without injecting any passion or originality into the script. The central conflict, which should be gripping and engaging, instead feels generic and uninspired. 

The dialogue is another significant issue. It’s stilted and unnatural, failing to convey any real depth or nuance. Characters speak in clichés and empty platitudes, making it hard to believe in their struggles or motivations.

The acting is equally disappointing. The cast delivers their lines with the enthusiasm of kids forced to do chores, contributing to the film's lifeless feel. This lack of energy and commitment can be attributed to both the actors and the director. 

Comparing this film to Roger Corman's infamous Fantastic Four movie might seem harsh, but it's a fitting analogy. Both films suffer from poor execution and a lack of soul. However, this film arguably fares worse due to its complete absence of engaging elements. To salvage such a project, the filmmakers would need to infuse genuine emotion into the script and inspire more compelling performances from the cast.

This film is a prime example of how not to craft a sci-fi narrative. Its soulless script, lifeless acting, and overall lack of direction make it a difficult watch. Audiences deserve more than a formulaic, uninspired story; they deserve a film that engages and excites on every level.",1.0

""Flow is a celebration of resilience and collective spirit in times of adversity, as well as a potent reminder of the consequences of human actions on the environment.

With its immersive animation, emotional music, and unique narrative approach, Gints Zilbalodis invites viewers of all ages and backgrounds to reflect on the ability to adapt and unite - not just among species, but within society itself.

It's a testament to the profound, universal messages that can reside in the simplest of stories, inspiring empathy, respect, and awareness of the fragility and beauty of nature.""

Rating: B+",8.0
823219,Straume,"Yes, this film is largely a visual treat but what more do we get here? A fairy tale about different spices getting along – except for with fishes of course, who are merely colorful props who conveniently don't scream. But this fairy tale has little to do with reality, as seen in Europe during the last decade – even if its crude message probably is largely why this film has been received so positively. 

Or maybe we are supposed to learn something about global warming? We know about that already but few change their lives much and this film won't change that.
So we are left with what is reminiscent of a PC game walkthrough video on Youtube. We can appreciate all the work that has gone into it but in the end it is a shallow experience.",5.0

823219,Straume,"Sometimes the simplest yet most profound messages we can receive come from the unlikeliest of sources. So it is with the second animated feature from writer-director Gints Zilbalodis, a stunningly beautiful, inspiringly insightful odyssey about a band of animals seeking to find their way and survive in a new world. When a great flood essentially destroys the world of man, a wide-eyed black cat must figure out how to get by when this consuming deluge wipes out the existence he has known, armed with only his own wits and the cooperation of fellow animal kindreds, including a capybara, a meerkat, a secretary bird and a pack of dogs, most notably a yellow Labrador retriever. Together this band of different creatures navigates the waters of this new world in an abandoned sailboat, learning how to work together to support one another and to stay alive, surmounting an array of challenges along the way. In the process, they collectively learn valuable life lessons that we as humans can all stand to follow, especially when confronted with circumstances not unlike those that we all must contend with in a world on the edge, conditions to which most of us can probably relate these days. The answers that these creatures come up with are often patently obvious, but the film thoughtfully prompts us to ask ourselves that, if these simple solutions are so readily apparent, why aren’t we doing more ourselves to embrace them in addressing our own current challenges? That’s a very good question and one of the greatest strengths of this widely acclaimed release. This dialogue-free offering, whose only sounds come from the authentic utterances of its animal protagonists and its emotive background score, features exquisite animation in its depiction of a world in transition, one showing the remnants of what’s been left behind and the emergence of what’s coming into being. While the narrative takes a little time to initially find its footing and is occasionally episodic as it unfolds, the various incidents it portrays as the story plays out are instructive, touching, meaningful and spot on in conveying the picture’s myriad insights, crafted in a way that shows more than tells and successfully avoids the temptation to spoon-feed audiences. “Flow” may be animated, but it’s by no means a cartoon, an accomplishment to which more films in this genre should attempt to aspire. This Golden Globe Award winner and Oscar nominee for best animated feature is a true gem, one from which we could all stand to learn a lot – and, one would hope, before we’re faced with circumstances like these ourselves.",8.0

823219,Straume,"After a fairly scary start with a group of growling dogs, our usually quite sedentary cat makes it’s way back to a comfortable bed just in time for an inundation to flood his surrounding forest dwelling. There is no sign of any human being anywhere, but a small boat floats by manned by a coypu. The cat hops aboard and after an initial spat, the host settles back to sleep and they continue to drift aimlessly along what appear to be brand new waterways, meeting an host of fellow creatures along the way. Some appear friendly, others less so with many of them dispossessed of their usual habitats and others rather thriving in their new aquatic environment. Initials suspicions and reticence starts to morph into something more friendly and the animals convey a message that better together might be their route to survival. Sometimes those choices cause conflict, or require leaps of faith and that is the message that is delivered quite effectively as their amiable escapades unfold. I didn’t find the animation that spectacular, but when married together with some intricately designed audio we are presented with a charming and quite potent tale of what makes them and, vicariously, us tick amidst a changing and beautifully imagined forest that also elicits an appreciation of a sense of change, vivacity, collaboration and of nature. It’s simply told, celebratory and enjoyable to watch.",7.0
823219,Straume,"Director Gints Zilbalodis has created a visionary work of art with “Flow,” an absolutely jaw-dropping, stunning animated film that takes viewers on a breathtaking journey through both the natural and mystical realms. Following a courageous cat and an unlikely band of animal companions as they navigate a flooded, post-apocalyptic world, the film is an emotionally charged, visually immersive film that combines high stakes, environmental themes, and an unforgettable sense of adventure.

This is a film that completely drew me in from the very first frame, and not just with its beautiful animation, but with its deep, resonant story about survival, cooperation, and the fragility of our planet. This is one of the best films of the year, and it’s unlike anything I have ever seen before.

The story centers around a little black cat whose home is devastated by a catastrophic flood. Forced to flee after a devastating event (there are no humans to be found and only traces of them remain), he eventually finds refuge on an abandoned boat. The cat teams up with a menagerie of other animals, including a capybara, a lemur, a bird, and a dog, all of whom have been displaced from their homes. Relying on trust, courage, and their collective wits to survive the increasingly dangerous environment, the animals must now work together to navigate the perilous waters in search of dry land.

What sets this story apart from other animated films is its compelling and unique approach to animal behavior. While the animals display primal instincts, the film also incorporates a fantasy element where they seem to take on more human-like qualities (thankfully none talk, and no words are spoken in the entire film).

Zilbalodis and his team focus on a more nuanced, naturalistic portrayal of these animals rather than having the characters engage in zany antics or delivering silly punchlines. There are subtle hints, like exploring the solitary nature of the cat while watching as he slowly learns the benefits of cooperating with others. One of the more interesting aspects of the story is when the animals form mini societies on their floating vessels, giving the film an intriguing balance between realism and imagination. Even through non-verbal communication, the interactions between the characters feel authentic, especially as their survival instincts kick in. This is incredibly thoughtful and sophisticated storytelling.

The visual style is breathtaking, as the film is set in a lush, flooded world. Everything feels so meticulously crafted in a way that evokes the haunting beauty and disquieting peril of a newly aquatic landscape. Just when you think the film can’t look any more spectacular, yet another scene comes along that’s even more stunning than the last. This is one for lovers of the art form of cinema.

The floodwaters that have taken over the planet become a character in their own right, creating an atmosphere of constant tension and uncertainty. Everything about this film kept me on the edge of my seat. This is a story of survival, and the animals struggle. This isn’t a story that’s all wrapped up in a neat little bow, and the environmental themes are a substantial, poignant meditation on climate change and the destruction of our planet’s ecosystems.

Zilbalodis wisely avoids making things too bleak or heavy-handed and finds moments of hope and warmth through the animals’ shared journey. There’s a beautiful message about cooperation and the power of friendship, especially in the face of insurmountable odds, that provides a constant (if faint) feeling of much appreciated optimism.

At its heart, “Flow” is a film about survival, trust, and community. Its narrative may be simple, but it’s filled with profound emotional depth. Whether you’re an animal lover or someone who enjoys a thoughtful ecological tale, this film offers something for everyone. It’s a beautifully crafted adventure that doesn’t shy away from difficult topics, but it also fills you with a sense of wonder and possibility.

By combining impressive visuals, heartfelt storytelling, and a powerful environmental message, “Flow” is as enchanting as it is thought-provoking. I was deeply moved by the film’s themes and captivated by not only the beauty of the animation, but also its overall spirit.

There's no evidence of any third party anywhere, with the father invariably found having killed himself after slaughtering just about everyone else. Thing is, fellow agent ""Harker"" (Maika Monroe) thinks that there's way more to it than that. She's got a sort of sixth sense when it comes to these things and soon she and ""Carter"" are on the trail of the eponymous character (the sparingly used but effective Nicolas Cage) who may - or may not - be the source of some cryptic messages left near the site of each atrocity. Central to her theories are some eerily looking dolls. There are child size, perfectly made with porcelain and contain mysterious aluminium spheres. What's the purpose of them? It turns out that ""Harker"" might be able to elicit some answers from her mother ""Ruth"" (Alicia Witt). She's not quite the full shilling but as the detective recalls an encounter with a stranger many years earlier, we begin to wonder if mum might be more involved... It's quirky this story with elements that make sense and others that dart about making it almost impossible to figure out who's doing what to whom nor, more importantly, why? The rather brutal denouement does let it down. It's rushed and serves to fill in years worth of intrigue with five minutes of dialogue - indeed, I couldn't help but wonder if a sequel was in the offing as the story wrapped all too abruptly. Monroe delivers well here, as does photographer Andres Arochi who helps create an almost claustrophobic atmosphere to add quite a bit of tension to the plot.

1226578,Longlegs,"I recently ventured to the cinema and caught a screening of the latest psychological thriller, ""Longlegs."" The film delves into the twisted world of a serial killer who is believed to be possessed by Satan, using his demonic abilities to target young girls born on the 14th of the month. He gifts these girls a doll, which remains lifeless and silent, serving as a sinister prelude to their impending doom.

Nicolas Cage portrays the enigmatic killer, appearing sporadically throughout the movie in an unsettling all-white ensemble with pale face paint and hair. His eerie rendition of ""Happy Birthday"" and unsettling gestures add to the film's chilling atmosphere, leaving viewers on edge about his potential accomplice.

""Longlegs"" exudes a retro vibe reminiscent of 1980s cinema, with a jarring visual style that may not resonate with contemporary audiences. The disjointed cinematography and truncated framing add to the film's unsettling nature, creating a sense of unease among viewers.

As a cinephile who appreciates the nuances of filmmaking, I found ""Longlegs"" lacking in substance and entertainment value.

1138194,Heretic,"I suppose that many of us have had the god-squad on the doorstep trying to peddle their philosophising but I doubt many are quite as prepared, or as tempting, as the butter-wouldn't-melt ""Reed"" (Hugh Grant) when the enthusiastic sisters ""Barnes"" (Sophie Thatcher) and ""Paxton"" (Chloe East) arrive at his door. Promises of a meeting with his wife and some blueberry pie lure them in and soon they are having a meaningful debate that rather puts the girls on edge. That anxiety only gets worse as there's no sign of the wife and the scented candle proves to have a most unusual, and illuminating, aroma. They conclude that getting out of his home is the best plan, but that isn't going to be straightforward. He has other plans, and they are going to have to play a game of belief/disbelief if they are to have any hope of getting back to their church. The horror aspects of this are not especially interesting - it's a sort of competent hybrid of ""Escape Room"" meets ""Cluedo"". What helps this stand out a bit more is a subtly menacing effort from Grant and the standard of the writing. The conversation between the three for the first half of the film is quite thought provoking in itself. It asks questions that are truly valid and worthy of consideration amongst those of or without organised faith. The assertions around ""iterations"", burgers and games of ""Monopoly"" also raise a few solid questions about carts and horses that I rather appreciated as we are invited to question or evaluate the whole scope of monotheistic religions and their role in our lives. The two women gel well together here too, realising that they are in some sort of peril - both intellectual and physical, and that latter threat is well demonstrated by some creepy settings and creatively used audio. I didn't love the conclusion - I actually found it really quite disappointing, as if Scott Beck had just run out of ideas or didn't quite have the courage of his earlier convictions, but this is the most substantial part I've seen Grant play in a while and he holds it together well. Not your typical psychological drama and worth a watch, I'd say.",7.0

1138194,Heretic,"In the new film “Heretic”, two missionaries named Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher) and Sister Paxton (Chloe East) spend their days in fellowship and looking to bring new members into their faith. Sister Paxton is the more sheltered of the two as Sister Barnes comes from the East Coast and joined the church through conversion and appears much wiser in the ways of the world to her colleague.

Eager to get her first new member for Sister Paxton; the two venture to visit Mr. Reed (Hugh Grant), who had earlier expressed interest in their church and as such; made his way onto the contact list for the girls.

A storm arrives at the same time the girls do but unable to enter the home of Mr. Reed without a female being present; they are assured that his wife is baking in the kitchen and accept his offer to come in out of the weather.

They find Mr. Reed charming and very well-versed in theology as he says that he has been studying religions for over a decade and his knowledge is very impressive to the girls yet his questions, answers, and tone start to become disturbing to the girls as does the absence of his wife whom he claims is just in the other room.

Looking for a chance to leave, the girls discover that they are locked in and the house has a metal overlay that blocks their cell signals. Further complicating matters is the increasingly odd behavior of Mr. Reed who insists that they are free to leave at any time yet confronts them with all manner of theological questions, theories, and challenges at every turn.

What follows is a chilling exercise in faith for the girls in a gripping film that keeps you guessing all along.

The cast is solid and Grant is very good playing against type. This is not the usual psycho slasher that audiences often see in films of this type but a deep psychological game of terror and manipulation as he believes that he is helping the girls see the truth amongst all the dogma.

The film does play a bit to Hollywood for my taste in the final act as certain revelations and outcomes went away from the clever premise that had been established in favor of more traditional situations, but the vast majority of the film was chilling, engaging, and captivating and was powered by strong performances all around.

Directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods who also wrote the film; are no strangers to Horror and Suspense as their resumes are filled with some very tense films and have crafted a film that works as an intense thriller.

4 stars out of 5",
1138194,Heretic,"No matter what anyone might say, putting lipstick on a pig doesn’t change the fact that one is still dealing with a pig. And that’s very much the case with this dismally failed attempt at smart horror from writer-directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods. When two naïve Mormon missionaries (Sophie Thatcher, Chloe East) visit the remote home of a creepy, loquacious middle-aged loner (Hugh Grant) in an attempt to convert him, the trio launches into a protracted conversation about the nature of “the one true religion.” To a certain extent, it’s an intriguing philosophical discussion – at least for a while – until it gradually descends into a series of longwinded fits and starts characterized by disjointed, unrelated, unresolved segments that try viewer patience. The dialogue increasingly amounts to a series of overwrought contrivances undermined by implausible character development, particularly among the two supposed innocents who begin spouting lines that are difficult to accept in light of their supposedly gullible, unsophisticated nature and narrow worldview. But then, in a desperate attempt to retain fading audience attention, the picture degenerates into little more than a meandering slasher movie, albeit with better production design than one typically finds in such fare. What’s more, this offering’s exasperating script heavily “borrows” from an endless stream of religious, philosophical and cinematic sources, one even suggesting that this could turn into the second coming of “The Butterfly Effect” and “Matrix” franchises. And, while Grant and his co-stars genuinely deliver more than capable portrayals of the three principals, even their performances aren’t enough to cover the inherent weaknesses of this material, no matter how much lipstick is applied to it. Considering the foregoing, I’m truly mystified by the much-celebrated response this offering has been accorded given its tiresome narrative and pretentious, largely pointless overall direction, an experiment that just doesn’t work. As a fan of the smart horror genre and its aim of elevating the content of more classic releases in this area of cinema, I’m seriously disappointed that the inspired creators of “A Quiet Place” (2018) haven’t come up with something better here, an outcome that’s definitely heretical in itself.",2.0
1138194,Heretic,"Written and directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods (65, Haunt, writers of A Quiet Place), Heretic is a so-called psychological horror that is disappointing on all fronts. After only seeing the trailer once months ago, I initially thought that Heretic was a film about a serial killer (Hugh Grant) who used his crazy mouse trap-contraption house to lure in religious, door-to-door service people and kill them.

While that is partially the case, Heretic follows two missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher, The Book of Boba Fett) and Sister Paxton (Chloe East, The Wolf of Snow Hollow). The two women go to the house of Mr. Reed (Grant) who has expressed interest in hearing more about their religion.

As Sister Barnes and Sister Paxton make their way inside, they soon find themselves trapped in Mr. Reed’s bizarrely intricate home featuring electricity on a timer, a front door that supposedly won’t open again until morning, and that the house being made of metal blocks cell phone signals. 

Reed, a theology major with vast knowledge of all religions, claims to have found the one true religion. Whether the two women will escape or if Reed knows what he’s talking about is factors into the cerebral aspect of the film.

Martin Freeman constantly looked miserable and bored out of his mind when he appeared in films like The Hobbit trilogy or the Sherlock TV series. He suddenly looked like he was having the time of his life when he shifted film genres, plunged into horror, and starred in the 2017 film Ghost Stories.

It seems to be the same case for Hugh Grant. While this isn’t his first horror film, Heretic is his first film in the genre in 36 years (Grant starred in The Lair of the White Room in 1988). Grant is noticeably lively in his performance in Heretic though and seems downright giddy to be torturing people.

With cinematography by Chung Chung-hoon (Last Night in Soho, The Handmaiden), Heretic has two visually memorable sequences thanks to how they’re shot. When Sister Barnes and Sister Paxton first arrive, Mr. Reed leaves the room to check on his “wife.” While he’s gone, Barnes turns the candle he blew out and discovers what the scent of the candle is. As she slowly turns the candle, the camera turns with it.

Reed has a miniature duplicate of his house complete with little figures that represent Sister Barnes and Sister Paxton. In a sequence when Sister Paxton is trying to run away from Mr. Reed, we’re following her movements in the miniature but it seamlessly transitions from the model to the real thing when she enters the room and slams the door.

The method in which Heretic is written is somewhat odd. Not quite horrific enough to be scary with its religion-defying dialogue taking center stage, Heretic is essentially a two-hour sermon attempting to destroy your faith with some splashes of blood and a raggedy woman or two dying in a blueberry pie.  

It feels like if you walked into Heretic devoted to the Mormon religion, you’ll walk out of the theater a different person. Mr. Reed’s arguments regarding all religions stemming from the same concept are portrayed in a way that is believable and convincing.

He somehow rambles about Monopoly and board games, music, and vinyl records to demonstrate similarities between certain board games, how some songs are essentially the same tunes with different lyrics, and that all religions are more similar than dissimilar.

While the dialogue-driven film can be interesting, it’s also fairly boring. There’s an unsettling aspect to Mr. Reed’s behavior that capitalizes on the tension in the film. But there are also these long stretches where nothing happens besides the next topic of conversation or a weak payoff where someone’s throat is cut with a box cutter or something.

Heretic is beautifully shot with a stellar performance from Hugh Grant, but its intriguing concept is drowned out by the desire to deconvert the audience and have a lukewarm reveal regarding whatever the one-true religion is. Watching the film is like being trapped in a church of a religion you don’t believe in with an overwhelmingly passionate pastor trying to dissuade you from ever coming back.",5.0
1138194,Heretic,"<em>'Heretic'</em> has its cast to thank for me fully enjoying it. The plot is most certainly suitably entertaining, don't get me wrong, but by the end it was almost wearing a tiny bit thin - and perhaps would have if not for those on the screen. All in all, though, it's a fun psychological horror.

Hugh Grant is tremendous in the main role, he is an actor that has the chops to do this genre - I've said it before, but I found his character in the <em>'Bridget Jones'</em> flicks to be creepy so that was all the proof I needed for the aforementioned to be true. Grant is certainly creepy here.

Chloe East and Sophie Thatcher are also good value, particularly the latter; this and 2025's <em>'Companion'</em> make for impressive work of her's - keen to see more. Along with the noted thinning, the end is a bit iffy but I'm happy to overlook any potential issues I may hold with it tbh.",8.0
1106739,Juror #2,"Expectant father ""Justin"" (Nicholas Hoult) is slated for jury duty and so duly sets off for the selection hoping that he doesn't get picked and that he can return to his wife to await the arrival of their bundle of joy. Sadly, though, they like the cut of his jib and selected he is. It's a murder trial with a man accused of brutally killing his girlfriend after a bar-room brawl. Prosecutor and aspiring DA candidate ""Faith"" (Toni Collette) thinks it's all in the bag, but defence attorney ""Resnick"" (Chris Messina) isn't so sure. As the proceedings commence, our second juror gets a bit of a shock. Some of this evidence is proving startlingly evocative. The more he hears of the incident, the more he begins to realise that his job as a juror might prove to be much more personal than he anticipated. With pressure from his wife and his fellow jurors to get it all over with, he has to fight to try and find a way to more fully explore the evidence and luckily he manages to convince one of their number ""Harold"" (J.K. Simmons) to help him. As the they dig deeper, what might they find and what might they incentivise the prosecutor to find too? I think Hoult holds this together well, and as the audience becomes better briefed on just who did what to whom, director Clint Eastwood still manages to keep the film engaging and tensely paced leaving the audience with quite a moral dilemma as truths start to out and sympathies become severely tested. Simmons supports well, as do Collette and Messina but Kiefer Sutherland appears too sparingly to make much impact on the story so it really is left to us and ""Juror #2"" to come to terms with what happened and with our own consciences.",7.0
1106739,Juror #2,"<em>'Juror #2'</em> is very, very good!

Clint Eastwood just keeps pumping out movies, gotta respect the hustle. As someone who has seen every film of his, evidently now including this 40th (and final?) directorial piece, I'd say that this is one of his best works. He has done much better too, of course, but this 2024 release is impressive enough.

It's a clear Eastwood picture, so obviously made by someone from the old days as opposed to something that is undoubtedly made by today's market. It's supremely crafted in most areas, it relies of its fair share of convenience and isn't perfect (e.g. some, only some, of the dialogue is iffy). However, the attention-hooking plot means things never get dull.

It does feel like a two hour movie, but I don't necessarily mean that negatively - again, I was never uninterested in what I was watching. The cast are excellent. They are spearheaded by Nicholas Hoult, someone I've found quite meh in other productions but here he merits praise.

Chris Messina and Toni Collette are enjoyable in their respective roles, while in more minor parts the likes of J. K. Simmons, Amy Aquino and Cedric Yarbrough are solid. Another plus, away from the faces, is the very pleasing score, so credit to Mark Mancina for the music.

1106739,Juror #2,"""Juror #2"" unfolds in an unhurried yet absolutely fascinating way and it is utterly spellbinding to watch  Justin Kemp (juror #2) as he slowly begins to realise he is becoming increasingly trapped with each passing moment and he has no clear options open to him to effect an escape from his predicament and no way to avoid ruination. The film really manages to achieve moments of quiet excitement, especially when more damning pieces of evidence begin to emerge like so much debris rising to the surface of a lake. It is engrossing as the film gradually begins to narrow the focus down to concentrate on Kemp and Faith Killebrew. They both know the true set of circumstances surrounding the night in question and now one of them must step forward and sacrifice the other in order for justice to be done or else the consequences of inaction will be the terrible and corrosive burden of guilt surrounding the crime in question which will eventually and inevitably consume and destroy them both.

539972,Kraven the Hunter,"I've been quite generous in how I've received (the apparently now finished) <em>'Sony’s Spider-Man Universe'</em>, but even I can't give you any positives for this one.

<em>'Venom'</em> is its peak, though I genuinely enjoyed <em>'Madame Web'</em> (don't @ me) and even (the not good) <em>'Morbius'</em> didn't overly bother me. <em>'Kraven the Hunter'</em>, however, did well and truly bore me. Aaron Taylor-Johnson offers a glimmer of hope, but this makes for a looooong 2hrs 7mins (why that long, I have no idea).

The first few scenes, whilst nothing exceptional, are actually perfectly OK - I thought so, anyway. Though pretty much from the introduction of a young Calypso (no hate on Ariana DeBose btw, I like her and she tries) the movie quickly spirals. The characters of Russell Crowe and Alessandro Nivola (he, too, tries) are, to put it kindly, rather irritating.

Christopher Abbott's role has some potential attached to it, though that countdown thing got repetitive real fast; almost as quick as 1... 2... nevermind. The stuff with Fred Hechinger's part, meanwhile, is bizarre, sure it makes sense based on his (bad) final scene but the whole voice bit felt silly at every moment; esp. when imitating Crowe's Nikolai.

Well, yes, but if that's the only card a film has then you might as well get your shirt off and play it! Sadly, that is all that can really be said for this plodding superhero adventure. The ""Kravinoff"" siblings ""Dimi"" (Billy Barratt) and ""Sergei"" (Levi Miller) are taken out of their posh school by their oligarch father (Russell Crowe) and taken on a hunt in Ghana to develop their masculinity. They are on the trail of a lion called ""Czar"" and it's an encounter with him and then with a local girl called ""Calypso"" (Diaana Babnicova) that sees the latter brother emerge injured but changed. Quite profoundly changed too! Skip on many years and the ""Sergei"" (now Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has no relationship with his father, though is still in contact with his brother (now Fred Hechinger), and he has developed some remarkably animalistic ninja skills. He's the ultimate in natural forces for good. Meantime, though, things are hotting up amongst the criminal fraternity and a chance re-encounter with a grown up ""Calypso"" (Ariana DeBose) sets up a denouement with a nasty baddie who has to survive on refrigerated gel packs from his rucksack else he gets especially thick-skinned. Along the way there are several, quite violent, escapades that allow the star to show off his physical prowess, Crowe to show off his thick Siberian accent and Hechinger to look about as weedy as possible. Thereafter there isn't an original bone in it's CGI-fest of a body. The script is actually pretty diabolical and the plot really struggles to get off the ground as this lumbers, quite literally, along for over two hours. It's as if it were a few episodes of a mini-series hastily condensed into a film; it's bitty, disjointed and the denouement is all rather underwhelming.

Firstly, this is a fresh, down to earth, departure from your standard Marvel Franchise films.Idiots in over bright Lycra or Spandex  outfits, are, thankfully, absent. 

Instead, you get a more conventional, satisfyingly  believable, character. One who happens to be have been given special powers, that feel primal and earthy, compared, for example, to hammers and lighting bolts.

Actions reasonable too, with settings I could relate to and a story that's well told, if unsurprisingly, somewhat formulaic.

I would have liked to see how the story arc would have gone in future films but unfortunately it probably won't get a sequel.

My advice to anyone watching movies these days is go see it yourself and don't believe the charged reviews.

I thought the story was good, the acting was fine and the special effects were done well and more grounded and gritty than your normal super hero movies.  Kraven was another antihero type in this film and I think that worked well for his introduction.

967847,Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,"Though it does sort of get going in the last twenty minutes or so, the rest of this is a really slow family discord drama that features hardly any ghosts but is more of a finding herself exercise for ""Phoebe"" (McKenna Grace) that involves her coming to terms with psuedo-father ""Gary"" (Paul Rudd) and relating to her very own chess-playing version of ""Moaning Myrtle"" - only this one's called ""Melody"" (Emily Alyn Lind). When we do actually focus on things mystic, the story revolves around a brass sphere that is covered with ancient hieroglyphics. This comes into the possession of 'Stantz"" (Dan Aykroyd) who takes it to the team for further investigation. Needless to say, that causes quite a bit of mayhem whilst, meantime, the mayor (William Atherton) is after the ""Ghostbusters"" for causing expensive havoc every time they trap a ghost. That contretemps will question the very existence of their firehouse operation and of their ongoing mission to boldy go... Anyway, as the plot lurches along we get the odd opportunity to see some proton packs in action; the old car gets put through it's paces and the original ""Bibendum"" ghosts get an outing or two, too, as a sort of bellwether for impending doom. That impending doom is all delivered, frostily, too little and too late to rescue this entirely derivative two hours from the cinema doldrums. The original cast - Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and Aykroyd really need to stop appearing to legitimise these sequels - they are not patch on the original and really do smell, strongly, of flogging the dead horse.

""GHOSTBUSTERS: FROZEN EMPIRE falls short of its predecessor, but the members of the classic and new cast inject enough energy, charm, and emotion to compensate for the narrative inconsistencies and pacing issues.

Mckenna Grace's remarkable performance carries the film, but putting all the narrative, thematic, and emotional weight on a single character generates inevitable problems.

It's unlikely to become the favorite installment for fans of the franchise, but it's still an adventure with enough entertainment to satisfy families around the world.""

Rating: B-",6.0
967847,Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,"Whilst not as awful as its 2016 counterpart, the latest instalment in the Ghost Busters franchise, is hardly noteworthy either.

Frozen Empire tries, in vain, to recapture the vibe of the first film from 1984. There's an earnest effort to re-establish the off the wall,  goofiness of the original. Even bringing in old cast members to help things along. Sadly the wry wit and humour that defined the old flick, not to mention the remarkably deep characterisations, is largely absent. 

What you are left with is empty mimicry that's none too inspiring, backed by a story and action that's not awful but really feels like its going through the motions. On the subject of the story, I will give kudos to the fact it is, at least, a little original and imaginative. 

Regrettably whilst this film is superficially watchable its also instantly forgettable, having none of the blockbuster potential found in the first film, way back when. That said and again, in fairness, society has moved on from Ghostbusters. Its unsophisticated by modern standards and is never going to be the kind of hit it was in simpler, cinematic times.

I think the final question then, is why keep trying? Is Hollywood really so bereft of new ideas, that reinventing the past is all it can aspire to?

In summary, tries to wring the last drop out of a well worn and frankly, worn out franchise, that's long since, had its day. Superficially watchable but also readily forgettable.",6.0
967847,Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,"I have seen both amazing and terrible Ghostbusters films in my lifetime, and this one falls somewhere in the middle. It doesn't reach the heights of the original, nor does it plummet to the lows of the less successful installments. I would rank this film slightly below Ghostbusters II. While it’s fun, it suffers from a messy story and too many characters.

The film's main issue lies in its sprawling narrative. With too many characters vying for attention, the story becomes a bit disjointed. For example, the original Ghostbusters worked so well because it focused on a tight-knit group of protagonists, allowing for rich character development and clear, coherent plot progression. In contrast, this film tries to juggle multiple subplots and character arcs, leading to a lack of focus.

While the movie has its enjoyable moments, the story feels scattered. Key plot points are often rushed or underdeveloped, leaving the audience wanting more depth and cohesion. For instance, a subplot involving a new character’s backstory is introduced but never fully explored, making their motivations and actions feel superficial. This scattered approach detracts from the overall narrative impact.

Despite these flaws, the film does have its charms. It’s a fun addition to the franchise and includes plenty of moments that fans will appreciate. The humor, special effects, and ghost-hunting sequences are all entertaining and Paul Rudd shines throughout.

However, it lacks the nostalgic appeal of Ghostbusters II. The second film, despite its own flaws, managed to capture the magic and charm of the original. This new installment doesn’t quite evoke the same feelings. It feels more like a modern reboot than a continuation of the beloved series. For example, the nods to the original films are present but often feel more like fan service than integral parts of the story.

While this latest Ghostbusters film is not without its faults, it is still a fun watch. It doesn’t quite capture the nostalgia or coherence of the earlier films, but it adds a new layer to the franchise that fans might enjoy catching on TV. It’s worth a watch for its entertainment value, even if it doesn’t fully live up to the legacy of its predecessors.",6.0

""Smile 2 not only proves to be the best horror movie of 2024, but it also stands out as one of the best horror sequels in recent years, improving upon all aspects that made the original a gigantic success. Through a thought-provoking exploration of trauma, loss, and guilt, the story’s rising emotional intensity elevates the fascinating horror elements, creating an unforgettable cinematic experience.

Naomi Scott’s career-best, riveting performance combines with technical qualities worthy of awards-season recognition, solidifying Parker Finn’s name as one of the most promising filmmakers in contemporary horror.""

Rating: A-",8.0
1100782,Smile 2,"An improvement on the (good) original.

Naomi Scott's performance is outstanding, she is so convincing and fully committed to the role all the way through - to the point that she elevates the film as a whole up a notch. The rest of the cast are good, e.g. Rosemarie DeWitt, but <em>'Smile 2'</em> is very much Scott's movie.

The run time is perhaps a little longer than it needs to be, though to be honest that is only a minor criticism in the grand scheme of things. Much of what is onscreen helps nullify any potential (minor) pacing issues, the violence and gore is quite graphic but it is nicely done and is exactly what we want to see from a production of this sort, let's be real.

I will say this does feature a few too many cheap jump scares, something I'm not a big fan of, but just like the above it isn't a notion that hinders the overall quality of the end result. Based on the ending, the next sequel could be a lot of fun - here's hoping!",
1100782,Smile 2,"Tween horror.  Perfect to have on in the background whilst making tiktoks or like somthing I dunno lol.
I get the feeling the script for this was written in text speak and emojis.  I'm not sure if this is Blumhouse, I couldn't summon enough interest to bother finding out.

If you've seen the first flick (not movie and certainly not film), you know what this is about, cheese ""jump scares"" that solely rely on the sound being loud and some tween-palette friendly ""gore"" - a bit of blood.  Nothing's shocking, horrifying or engaging and the ""acting"" is terrible, which is maybe the most shocking element.

That guy that was in The White Lotus, I've seen be good in things other than this, he's not good in the 5 minutes or so he's in this.
Naomi Scott waddles round like a less obese version of Florence Pugh with even less charisma.  She's pretending to be a pop star, a story misstep that leads to some AI generated music that somehow sounds a decade or so dated.

Film could have been vastly improved if it was ~80 minutes of Scott being attack with a screwdriver, but that didn't happen and it's 2hours of mediocrity.  Looking at the sidebar here, it made money, so I guess we're getting Smile 3.  With some luck, that will be an entirely AI project and no actual creatives will be harmed in the creation process.",

The film benefits from a higher budget of $28 million, compared to the original's $17 million, which is evident in its enhanced production quality. The opening prologue is particularly gripping, setting a tense and immersive tone right from the start.

Director Parker Finn adopts a more mainstream approach with effective jump scares and incorporates intense gore scenes that heighten the horror experience. The narrative cleverly blurs the lines between reality and illusion, keeping viewers on edge and questioning what's real.

He spends his time heavily guarded and constantly on the move as he pretty much controls the synthetic drug trade in and out of his country. What does he want with ""Rita"" though? Well tempted by a great deal of money, she makes the perilous trip to meet him and find out. Suffice to say she gets quite a shock when she discovers that he is determined to become a woman. ""Rita"" is now charged with the ultra-discrete task of finding a surgeon who can turn ""Manitas"" into ""Emilia"". Not only is this highly dangerous for the lawyer, but it's also no walk in the park for the gangster or his family who will need to be relocated and convinced that dad is no more. What now ensues tests the mettle of both characters, especially as the erstwhile father struggles rather more than he'd anticipated when it comes to losing his wife ""Jessi"" (Selena Gomez) and his two young children. Can he stay out of their lives for ever or might he succumb to that temptation and set the cat amongst the familial pigeons? The story is a bit too episodic and the characterisations superficial at times, which is a shame. That said, though, there is still a strong and emotionally powerful effort from Karla Sofía Gascón as the ruthlessly violent killer who undergoes more than a physical transformation over the four or five year period this drama covers. Saldana also holds this together well delivering an engaging performance as a character who has perhaps lost faith in what the system can do to make things better for ordinary people, so adopts a more ""inside the tent of the enemy"" approach. It's peppered with musical numbers. Some of those work better than others at introducing delicacy, love, lust and anger into the proceedings but let's be under no illusions that there are any great singers here. I found the denouement a bit rushed and frankly rather weak, but the whole film does shine rather a provocative light on attitudes to gender identification and just as importantly to corruption and the relatively minimal value placed on human life in country where someone almost always works for someone else. It's just a little over two hours, but once it gets into gear it doesn't hang around making for a decent watch tackling important topics that's worth a gander.",7.0
974950,Emilia Pérez,"It generally takes tremendous courage to stand up and proclaim that the Emperor is indeed naked, especially in the face of a crowd of willfully blind onlookers who contend otherwise. Nevertheless, there are times when this truly needs to be said in light of an inexplicably misguided view to the contrary. And that’s certainly the case with the latest from often-overrated writer-director Jacques Audiard. This jumbled mess of a film can’t make up its mind if it wants to be an edgy musical (given its forgettable songs and original score), a quasi-campy comedy (despite its palpable lack of bona fide humor but with a narrative that’s admittedly frequently laughable), a crime thriller (one that feebly grows ever more pretentious, meandering, implausible and uncompelling with each passing frame) or a treatise on forgiveness and redemption that unapologetically drips with overwrought political correctness. In essence, this offering follows the exploits of Manitas (Karla Sofía Gascón), a Mexican drug cartel warlord who wants to undergo the transgender transition process to liberate the inner woman that has been inside him since birth, aided by a supposedly articulate and self-righteous lawyer (Zoe Saldaña) who hastily and seemingly thoughtlessly sells out with the promise of a financial windfall for her assistance. After undergoing the process, however, the newly emerged Emilia Pérez has regrets about her past, both in terms of her brutal “professional” behavior and the abandonment of her kids and shrewish, self-centered wife (a fine performance by Selena Gomez in one of the film’s few praiseworthy assets). However, this change of heart, while modestly understandable, generally lacks believability. And, given the utterly reprehensible nature and baffling, head-scratchingly contradictory choices of all the principals, it’s difficult to fathom how anyone would care a whit about any of them. That’s especially true for the picture’s lead, whose actions do little to generate any kind of meaningful empathy for transgender individuals and causes. And, through it all, the story is mystifyingly augmented with a slew of inconsistently timed, largely unremarkable musical production numbers that add precious little to the overall story (they could have been left out entirely and it would likely have made for a more compelling release). In sum, the finished product plays like a preposterously melodramatic Italian opera libretto mixed with elements from pictures like “Sicario” (2015) and any number of cheesy Mexican soap operas. How this cinematic morass has managed to garner as much attention as it has received is truly beyond me. That’s especially true with the many undeserved accolades it has received, including 10 Golden Globe Award nominations (a virtually unheard-of number for any film in this awards competition), as well as honors from the Critics Choice Awards, the American Film Institute, and numerous film festivals, including the prestigious events in Cannes and Toronto. Indeed, don’t be fooled into thinking that the blend of diverse elements here should be taken for inventive, inspired originality.

Could you give up your own family to live as your true self? How much can a person change at their core? Does the 'wolf' remain a wolf?

The musical pieces do take some getting used to and I'm not entirely convinced by most of them, but again somehow it didn't overly bother me whilst watching.

There's no doubt, for me, that the greatest part of this is Zoe Saldaña. I've seen her in many roles before and I love her in those, especially <em>'Avatar'</em> and even in a tiny <em>'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'</em> role, but I'd say this is her best performance from the 11 movies that I've seen from her. Outstanding!

I also enjoyed those behind Saldaña, namely Karla Sofía Gascón and Selena Gomez; I watched the latter in 2012's <em>'Spring Breakers'</em> a few weeks back, her acting has improved impressively. I do think if the cast weren't as strong as they are, I may have liked this much less.

938614,Late Night with the Devil,"How far are you willing to go in realizing your ambitions? Would you be willing to make big sacrifices? Associate with shady beings? Sell your soul? Those are among the possibilities raised in the latest hair-raising smart horror/comedy from the writing-directing duo of Cameron and Colin Cairnes. This documentary-style offering presents the supposedly lost recording (complete with allegedly never-before-seen found footage) of a 1970s late night talk show hosted by comedian/TV personality Jack Delroy (David Dastmalchian) whose goal is to unseat Johnny Carson’s eminently popular Tonight Show as the premier after-hours choice of viewing. Delroy’s Night Owls broadcast is modestly successful, but it never manages to win the late night ratings race, so he desperately looks for ways to nudge his program over the top. When he decides to host a Halloween show with an array of occult/paranormal guests – capitalizing on a growing trend at the time – he believes he’s hit on the formula to achieve his goal. But, as the show progresses, he finds himself in over his head as events begin to spiral out of control. Viewers both on and off the screen are kept in suspense with a well-integrated blend of humor, high camp and unexpectedly spooky moments involving a hammy, self-righteous psychic medium (Fayssal Bazzi), an egomanical magician-turned-debunker (Ian Bliss), and an escaped teenage cult member (Ingrid Torelli) and her psychologist caregiver/surrogate parent (Laura Gordon). As things deteriorate, Jack tries to hold the show together with the aid of his producer (Josh Quong Tart) and flunky sidekick (Rhys Auteri). But, as the stakes are continually upped, that task grows ever more difficult, especially when supernatural influences begin to assert themselves in the studio, threatening both the broadcast and the fulfillment of the host’s long-cherished dream. Although occasional pacing issues, a periodically disjointed narrative and a somewhat overblown final act can get in the way of the smoothness of the story flow, these shortcomings are made up for by the film’s superb period piece production design, its clever writing and its fine performances, most notably that of the protagonist. And, in the end, it’s all served up with lots of laughs and a tidy moral of the story. Admittedly, “Late Night with the Devil” probably would have worked better as a Halloween release than a piece of springtime movie fare, but that doesn’t lessen the entertainment value of this inspired production, one thar shows horror flicks can indeed do more than just see how high it can make the final body count.",7.0
938614,Late Night with the Devil,"With his days of chasing Johnny Carson in the television ratings long gone, the now struggling and recently bereaved talk show host ""Jack Delroy"" (David Dastmalchian) is staring cancellation in the face. Then he and producer ""Leo"" (Josh Quong Tart) come up with an idea for a riveting Halloween special. The gist of what comes now purports to be an off-air recording of that lost transmission from 1977 - and it's quite literally hair raising. His first guest is a medium, his second an out-and-out sceptic and his third - well they have quite an unique claim to fame - and it's this last quarter of the film that comes ""alive"". Sadly, the rest of this feature is rather hampered by the constant (virtual) advertising breaks that completely suck the pace out of the thing. They are designed to, in monochrome, fill in a little of the back-stage machinations as the programme goes to air but for me, they just interrupted - far too frequently - the culmination of the truth or fake storyline. Dastmalchian does an half decent job here, but the plaudits really belong to Ian Bliss and his sarcastic ""Carmichael Haig"" character. He's the poacher-cum-gamekeeper cynic who has a ridiculing put down for just about everything that emanates from the other characters. Projectile vomiting or chair levitation - he has an plausible explanation. That's maybe part of the film's problem in general. Though set in the 1970s when these kind of visual effects were less prevalent, the whole thing just comes across as a perfectly plausible ratings-gathering gimmick. Whilst that's not necessarily a bad thing, it does rather rob the film of any pretence of horror or mystery. In fact, by the conclusion it seemed more designed to send up the whole principle of half-baked, late-night American television hosted by vain, ambitious but largely talentless men in suits. It's short and sweet, and doesn't hang around - but I just didn't find it particularly shocking or innovative. Wait til it's on the television, I'd say.",6.0

938614,Late Night with the Devil,"Late Night with the Devil demonstrates how much can be achieved with a quality script and exceptional acting.

First off the performance by  David Dastmalchian is simply excellent, in every sense. He beautifully and convincingly pulls off a Johnny Carson style, impression of a late night 70's interviewer. The man is wholly believable and to be honest, its his performance that drew me in and kept me watching till the end.

The story is well rendered too. Its not exceptional but there's a decent amount of originality and a sense of ambiguity, especially surrounding the main character to create intrigue and interest. Has the interviewer already made a shadowy pact with the devil? What price will he pay? Tune in, to see. 

On the down side there are obvious budgetary constraints in play. That said, but there is so much quality on offer here in terms of performances from the cast and a solid story, its really not overly noticeable. 

In summary, a flick defined by exceptional performances and a quality, Faustian style, back story. A must watch if you like ""quality"" horror.",8.0
1084736,Le Comte de Monte-Cristo,"""Dantès"" (Pierre Niney) is to be promoted to captain a ship for the wealthy ""Morrel"" (Bruno Raffaelli) after he disobeyed orders at sea and dived in to rescue a woman from drowning. This action immediately earns him the enmity of the now fired captain ""Danglars"" (Patrick Mille) and then just as his joy is to be complete with his marriage to ""Mercedes"" (Anaïs Demoustier) the soldiers arrive and he's implicated in a Napoleonic plot! The prosecutor, ""de Villefort"" (Laurent Lafitte) appears sympathetic and accepts his pleas of innocence, but when his close friend ""Morcef"" (Bastien Bouillon) is called upon to vouch for ""Dantès"" his own envious agenda takes hold and next, our naive young seaman is heading to the solitude of the Chateau D'If from which prisoners never escape. As the years of relentless frustration and boredom go by, his only conversation is a regular call from his jailers to see if he's still alive. Then a miracle occurs. Another prisoner has been tunnelling for years and inadvertently breaks through to his cell. It's this man - the Abbé Faria (Pierfrancesco Favino) - who gives him more than a little education as they try to dig their way to the sea wall. It's not to be for both, though, but armed with a knowledge that could change his life for ever, he manages to trick the guards and make it to land. It's now that the story of revenge hots up as we jump forward a few years and are introduced to the eponymous Count. He travels in style, has great wealth and style and is determined to avenge himself on the three men who framed him. As with himself, these men have gone on to great things with his denouncing friend now married to his love, ""Danglars"" owning a great trading fleet and the prosecutor now a powerful state official. ""Dantès"" has used his time well, assembling some allies whose roles in this unfolding drama are gradually revealed to us as politics, greed and jealousy stride to the fore of this classically designed production. The lavish costumes, stately homes and opulence of their lives contrasts well with the poverty and ruin faced by those collaterally damaged by the ambitions of men who cared but for themselves, and for whom our dashing and calculation gazillionaire is gunning. Nimey (who occasionally looked a bit like Kevin Kline here?) delivers that wronged and now Machiavellian characterisation especially well. There are also strong efforts from the younger characters ""Albert"" (Vassili Schneider); ""André"" (Julien De Saint Jean) and ""Haydée"" (Anamaria Vartolomei). It's essentially a thoroughly potent story of revenge, but it's as much about just how that can become a toxic influence that can eat into a man's soul and the challenge for ""Dantès"" and those around him whom he loves - however unwillingly on the surface - is not to become an obsessed demon every bit as ghastly as those he wishes to punish. It's this slow, dripping, evolution that the film delivers enthrallingly as we see this troubled man tread an increasingly conflicted line between love and hate. Revenge is said to be a dish best served cold, but like most things served cold - it doesn't keep for long.",7.0
1084736,Le Comte de Monte-Cristo,"The 2024 reimagining of The Count of Monte Cristo is a cinematic triumph, setting a new benchmark for adaptations of the beloved Dumas classic. Directed by Jacques Bernard, this latest French interpretation is nothing short of spellbinding, with Pierre Niney delivering a portrayal of Edmond Dantès that feels both deeply authentic and timeless. From Dantès’ naive beginnings to his calculated, unrelenting vengeance, Niney embodies the role with a level of intensity and depth that captivates from the very first scene.

Visually, the film is breathtaking. The cinematography paints each setting—from the claustrophobic depths of Château d'If to the grandeur of Parisian society—in vivid, atmospheric detail. Every shot feels like a piece of art, masterfully capturing both the story’s drama and its rich historical backdrop. The film’s use of real locations transports viewers to the story’s world, making each moment feel hauntingly real, a rare achievement in period cinema.

Adding to the experience is a lush, evocative score that amplifies the film’s emotional power. The music captures Dantès' inner turmoil and triumph with remarkable sensitivity, lending every high-stakes scene an added layer of tension. It’s a soundtrack that will stay with you long after leaving the theater, a perfect companion to Dumas' tale of betrayal and redemption.

The film’s costumes, masks, and makeup are absolutely spectacular. Every detail—whether the intricate designs of Dantès' masquerade attire or the worn expressions on characters weathered by hardship—feels perfectly tailored to the time period. The masks, in particular, add an air of intrigue, shrouding key characters in mystery and creating a rich visual metaphor for the story’s themes of deception and disguise.

At a generous three hours, The Count of Monte Cristo thoroughly explores Dantès' journey, though I found myself wishing it were even longer. An adaptation of this depth and quality could have easily been extended to a two-part epic, much like last year’s exquisite French rendition of The Three Musketeers, with an expanded runtime of four or five hours to fully savor each intricate turn of Dantès' revenge.

In every respect, this 2024 version is a masterpiece and, without a doubt, the definitive Monte Cristo for a modern audience. It balances faithfulness to Dumas' original with bold, cinematic flair, capturing the story's essence in a way that is grand, poignant, and unforgettable. This is a film that will surely stand the test of time.",9.0

""The Idea of You can't seem to find enough standout elements to compensate for the lack of narrative innovation, thematic depth, or compelling execution.

Michael Showalter gets lost in the shallowness of the genre's countless formulas, the excessive fluffiness of the dialogues, and the dull clichés that fill a very familiar premise, failing to justify a frustratingly incoherent ending.

843527,The Idea of You,"I am not usually drawn to romantic films where a woman changes her life and finds love when she least expects it. These films don't typically resonate with me, but I watched this one for review purposes and found myself really enjoying it. While the plot is simple, it is not without charm, and the acting meets the expectations for this genre, complete with its share of cheesy moments. However, it tells a pleasant story with some worthwhile themes.

The plot may be straightforward, but it is executed well, providing a satisfying narrative arc. The story centers on a woman trying something new and unexpectedly finding love, a familiar trope that is handled with care and sincerity. 

Anne Hathaway is the standout performer in this film. She has a remarkable ability to elevate even the most formulaic scripts, bringing nuance and depth to her character. Her performance is both heartfelt and engaging, making her character's journey compelling to watch. 

While the film includes many of the genre's typical elements, such as predictable plot points and moments of cheesy dialogue, it manages to use these conventions to its advantage. The familiar beats of the romantic drama are present but are handled with a light touch that makes them enjoyable rather than tiresome. 

This film is a pleasant surprise. It might not break new ground in the romantic drama genre, but it offers a heartwarming story with strong performances. It's an enjoyable movie to watch with your significant other, providing a comforting mix of romance, humor, and genuine emotion. If you're looking for a feel-good film that touches on themes of love and self-discovery, this one is definitely worth a watch.",7.0
1034541,Terrifier 3,"This maybe hit the cinemas a month too early as there's a distinctly festive feel to this latest outing for the menacing ""Art"" the clown. He descends upon the townsfolk with blood-thirsty enthusiasm causing some brutal carnage but then he and his equally heinous pal ""Vicky"" (Samantha Scaffidi) go for a long nap. It's a pair of unfortunate demolition guys who provide their wake up entertainment and rejuvenated, they set out in search of ""Sienna"" (Lauren LaVera) and brother ""Jonathan"" (Elliott Fulham) - and woe betides anyone who gets in the way - even if you are dressed as Santa Claus. This is by far the best of the three so far, I think. There's much less repetition with the standard slashing-fayre and a bit more, dare I say, intimacy from our ""Terrifier"" as David Howard Thornton imbues his character with more akin to an emotional and quirky mime artist. There's more sadness, mischief and playfulness as he wields everything from an axe to a chain-saw. Shower sex might never be the same again! It's really the last half hour that gets it moving and though that scenario is largely predictable and I have to say that none of the speaking-part acting here is really very good, the tension mounts nicely and there's an entertaining degree of shock mixed with dark humour and Christmas gifts to raise a smile and maybe the one hair on the back of your neck towards the denouement. Sure, it's formulaic and there aren't so many surprises, but they are getting better and moving away from the Hammer style of ketchup gore and annoying, hysterical, frat-style characters that we've seen before.

1034541,Terrifier 3,"**How ""Terrifier 3"" Redefines Horror Cinema and Mirrors Societal Anxieties**

**Introduction**
In a cinematic landscape often dominated by high-budget blockbusters and familiar franchises, ""Terrifier 3"" emerges as a remarkable exception. Directed by Damien Leone, this low-budget horror film has defied industry expectations by grossing over $82 million worldwide against a modest $2 million budget. Beyond its financial success, the film offers a profound exploration of psychological fears, societal tensions, and subtle political commentary, redefining the potential of horror cinema in the 21st century.

**A Subversion of Holiday Traditions**
Set against the ironically cheerful backdrop of Christmas Eve, ""Terrifier 3"" subverts traditional holiday themes by delving into the darkest corners of human fear. The malevolent antagonist, Art the Clown - portrayed with chilling intensity by David Howard Thornton - embodies unpredictability and chaos. His reign of terror over Miles County isn't just a series of gruesome events; it's a relentless assault on the notions of safety, normalcy, and the comfort typically associated with the holiday season.

**Psychological Exploration**
At its core, the film is a psychological study of fear and human responses to extreme situations. It taps into Carl Jung's concept of the ""shadow self,"" compelling both characters and viewers to confront the darker aspects of their psyche. Art the Clown is not merely a villain; he represents repressed anxieties and the chaotic potential within society. The notably subdued reactions of audiences - such as the silent screening experiences I experienced in CinemaCity in Romania - highlight the film's ability to reach deep into the subconscious, evoking a primal response that transcends typical cinematic experiences.

**Social Commentary and Contemporary Relevance**
""Terrifier 3"" serves as a mirror reflecting contemporary societal fears. In an era marked by global uncertainties and the erosion of traditional safety nets, the film's disruption of the holiday idyll resonates powerfully. It challenges the illusion of security in familiar settings, suggesting that chaos can intrude upon life without warning. This theme is particularly poignant given current global anxieties related to political polarization, social unrest, and the fragility of societal structures.

**Subtle Political Undertones**
The movie subtly weaves in commentary on the divisiveness and unpredictability that have characterized recent political landscapes, particularly echoing sentiments reminiscent of calls to ""make it great again."" Even it might be a bit of a stretch interpretation it lands very well and align in reality we are today. Art the Clown's embodiment of chaos and his assault on societal norms can be interpreted as an allegory for the breakdown of traditional structures and the rise of polarizing forces. His relentless terror reflects the disruption of established conventions, forcing communities to grapple with unprecedented challenges - a parallel to the societal upheavals experienced during turbulent political times.

The narrative also examines leadership and authority. The inability of societal institutions within the film to contain or comprehend the terror inflicted by Art the Clown mirrors real-world frustrations with ineffective governance in the face of crises. This reflection invites contemplation on how societies become vulnerable when trust in leadership erodes.

_Note: The interpretations presented regarding the political undertones, are my personal opinions and reflections. Don't get to excited! :)_

**David Howard Thornton's Masterful Performance**
Thornton's portrayal of Art the Clown elevates the character from a mere slasher antagonist to a symbol of deeper psychological, social, and political fears. His ability to convey menace without dialogue relies on physicality and expressive nuance, creating a sinister charisma that is both repulsive and captivating. This performance is instrumental in making the film's thematic explorations resonate so profoundly with audiences.

**The Appeal of Extreme Horror**
The film's financial success, despite - or perhaps because of - its extreme gore and brutality, speaks to a cultural fascination with boundary-pushing content. ""Terrifier 3"" taps into the audience's desire for cathartic experiences, offering a space to explore intense emotions and confront the darker facets of humanity. This attraction to extreme horror can be seen as a form of collective processing of fear and uncertainty, providing both an escape from and a reflection of real-world tensions.

**Implications for the Film Industry**
""Terrifier 3"" challenges conventional wisdom in the film industry regarding the profitability and impact of low-budget productions. Its success demonstrates that audiences are hungry for content that is innovative, thought-provoking, and willing to push boundaries. The film exemplifies how strategic storytelling and thematic depth can overcome financial limitations, suggesting a shift in how success can be achieved in cinema.

For filmmakers and industry professionals, ""Terrifier 3"" serves as a case study in leveraging genre conventions to explore complex themes while engaging audiences on multiple levels. It highlights the potential for horror films to transcend entertainment, becoming vehicles for social commentary and philosophical inquiry.

**Conclusion**
""Terrifier 3"" is more than a horror film; it's a bold artistic statement that challenges viewers psychologically, socially, and potentially politically . Damien Leone has crafted a work that is unflinching in its depiction of terror yet rich with depth and relevance. The movie invites audiences not only to experience fear but to question its origins and implications within the context of contemporary society.
As the film continues to captivate and unsettle viewers worldwide, it redefines the potential of horror cinema in the 21st century. ""Terrifier 3"" stands as a testament to the power of storytelling that is unafraid to delve into the complexities of existence, reflecting and challenging the societal and political currents of our times.

1034541,Terrifier 3,"The third installment of Terrifier promised to surpass the expectations of slasher fans, but unfortunately, it falls short due to a script that loses its way halfway through the movie. What begins as an intriguing narrative with potential to explore Art the Clown’s backstory quickly dissolves into a series of chaotic, disconnected scenes that seem to exist solely to justify the excess of gore.

Character development is practically non-existent, and any attempt to offer a narrative arc is abandoned in favor of an endless parade of graphic violence. While the special effects are impressive and true to the visceral spirit of the saga, it feels like an empty spectacle without a story to support it.

For fans of extreme gore, Terrifier 3 might meet expectations, but even for them, the lack of coherence in the script and the absence of a solid plot might prove frustrating. What could have been an opportunity to take the franchise to new levels of depth and creativity ends up being an exercise in shock for shock’s sake.

1114513,Speak No Evil,"<em>'Speak No Evil'</em> is supremely well done!

I felt unsettled from pretty much the get-go. That's because you can see the general direction that the movie is going to head, though that doesn't hampen the feeling of unease that is present all the way through. I did actually think whilst watching that the film was being a tad dragged out, though by the credits I was fully sold on what I had just seen.

James McAvoy is outstanding, I knew he was capable of portraying such a creepy and unhinged character from seeing some of his other work. <em>'Split'</em> for one, though also, oddly, <em>'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'</em>; I always got creeped out when we first see his Mr. Tumnus.

Mackenzie Davis impresses as well, as do Scoot McNairy and Aisling Franciosi in fairness; youngsters Alix West Lefler and Dan Hough do well too. The final scene with the latter is quite something, I thought it was going to play out slightly differently (i.e. what Ron does to Carl, for any fellow <em>'The Walking Dead'</em> fans) so to see it go they way it did was unexpected - but, without question, welcome.

1114513,Speak No Evil,"How many folks have you met on holiday and promised to go and visit when you all get back home?

Initially it's all good fun - even if the sleeping arrangements leave something to be desired, but gradually it becomes clear that all is not as it might be amidst this idyllic setting. When young ""Ant"" manages to convey a menacing secret to ""Aggie"" then a distinct panic sets in amongst the visitors who conclude that a midnight flit is in order. Of course, it's not going to be that easy and adaptability and ingenuity become the family's buzzwords as things become a great deal more dangerous. It does come alive a bit for the last twenty minutes, even though these are all just a little far-fetched, but the rest of this is really little more than a showcase for McAvoy to shine. To be fair, he does turn in a decent enough effort eventually but we spend far too much time building to that denouement. The preamble, some on their holiday and most at their rustic residence all advances the storyline too slowly and meanderingly to sustain enough interest to carry it's almost two hour duration, and personally, I found the likelihood that these people would ever have become friends in the first place about as remote as his house.

""Speak No Evil may not reach the visceral depth of the Danish original, but it offers a more accessible, commercially appealing approach.

The changes in story and tone may divide fans of the 2022 psychological thriller, but there's something to be said about the effectiveness of the stellar performances - James McAvoy is mesmerizing - and the more complex dynamic between the central characters. The thematic exploration of politeness and the pressure to adhere to social norms, even when they conflict with personal safety, remains thought-provoking, though the credit here goes to the original.

For those who prefer a ""softer"" experience in terms of emotional and physical violence, this remake is a valid version that, while not surpassing the original, manages to deliver a distinct experience for the audience.

Even with her mother (Amy Morton) there and in the full glare of a packed church, she cannot find five good things to say about the man. Quickly we learn - through some flashbacks - just why that is, and just why she's grown up to be a bit of a romantic. Then she encounters neuro-surgeon ""Ryle"" (Justin Baldoni) and there is instant chemistry. She then opens a long-dreamed of flower shop and a stranger walks in seeking a job. Guess what? She's ""Allysa"" (Jenny Slate) who just happens to be the sister of her enigmatic stranger. Maybe they can make a go of things? Well a dinner one evening brings her face to face with ""Atlas"" (Brandon Sklenar) and that takes us back down the path of retrospection as it turns out that in her younger days, she (Isabela Ferrer) has met this vagrant (Alex Neustaedter) and they's had quite an intense relationship until her father (Kevin McKidd) caught them, and - well you can use your imagination. When ""Ryle"" catches them chatting, he suspects the worst and that proceeds to cause his behaviour to materially change the dynamics as matters take a series of quite unpleasant turns. Now, quite why anyone thought this was a film worth making eluded me. Sure the subject matter is serious, but this plodding drama just takes way too long to get going and then when it might to become more compelling it runs out of steam. The camerawork pays far too much superficial attention to the undercooked character of ""Lily"" and the writing all too often resorts to power-ballad mode when the story becomes potentially more poignant and resonant. We know that the gist of the plot is to underscore not just the effects of domestic violence in the present, but to try and understand the sources so that path need never be taken again, but it's all presented in too shallow a fashion and could easily lose half an hour without impacting on the thrust - such as it is - of the drama. It's disappointing.",6.0
1079091,It Ends with Us,"I found <em>'It Ends with Us'</em> to be largely great, though the way it ends does make me question how I feel about it.

The performances of Blake Lively, Justin Baldoni <em>(just me who thinks he looks a touch like Runar from <em>'Ice Age'</em>? ...)</em>, Brandon Sklenar, Jenny Slate - heck, even Isabela Ferrer and Alex Neustaedter <em>(iffy likeness aside)</em> - are stellar. I sensed a lot of chemistry between Lively & Baldoni and Lively & Sklenar, which is impressive to succeed in that area twice.

Pace-wise the movie jumps along nicely, all the other major elements like editing, music and whatever are all well done and are only plus points. However, the conclusion disappoints a bit. I do think it just about regains its footing to produce a positive ending, though how it gets there by wrapping up the relationship between Lively's Lily and Baldoni's Atlas left me feeling a bit uneasy. As did a few other scenes, though they were of course as intended.

Amusing that I'm pretty sure I was the only dude (or at least one of a few) in a packed cinema watching this. Upon exiting, visually I kinda felt like Will Smith in that famous <em>'The Pursuit of Happyness'</em> <em>(which I still haven't seen btw, gotta get on that)</em> crowd scene - only surrounded by women. Bit awkward, I can't lie. ""Will watch anything!"" evidently leads me astray sometimes!",8.0
1079091,It Ends with Us,"Amazing movie, I really like it. It is outstanding.",
1079091,It Ends with Us,"It Ends With Us, directed by Justin Baldoni and based on Colleen Hoover's bestselling novel, explores the complexities of love and domestic abuse through the eyes of Lily Bloom (Blake Lively). The film captures Lily's journey from a hopeful flower shop owner to a woman facing the harsh realities of her relationship with Ryle (Justin Baldoni), a charming but abusive neurosurgeon.

My Experience:

Watching It Ends With Us was both impactful and frustrating. The cinematography was beautiful, and Lively delivered a nuanced performance that conveyed Lily's internal struggles effectively. However, I felt the film struggled with pacing and often leaned too heavily on melodrama, which detracted from its emotional weight. The portrayal of domestic violence was raw and unsettling, but at times it felt like it glossed over the deeper implications of such trauma.

While I appreciated the film’s attempt to address serious themes, the resolution felt overly neat and left me questioning its message about healing and forgiveness. Overall, It Ends With Us left me with mixed feelings; it was visually engaging and thought-provoking but ultimately fell short of delivering a satisfying emotional payoff.

1111873,Abigail,"I don't know that I've heard Tchaikovsky ever used so menacingly before, but here his ""Swan Lake"" and some deadly pas seul are used to good effect! A group of kidnappers has been assembled by ""Lambert"" (Giancarlo Esposito) to kidnap the daughter of a wealthy man. They are to whisk her away to a remote, quite spooky, manor house where she is to be held hostage til dad stumps up $50m. Thing is, this butter-wouldn't-melt little girl has a secret even bigger than most of the rather disparate gang of folks who used their complementary skills to snatch her. These folks are led by ""Frank"" (Dan Stevens) and it's ""Joey"" (Melissa Barrera) who is left to keep an eye on the young ""Abigail"" (Alisha Weir). Quite quickly we realise that it's not her who is trapped in their web, but vice-versa and what now ensues sees quite a fun series of daft and gruesome encounters as their gang gradually dwindles and they have to fight for their lives! It runs out of steam a bit towards the ending - which seems to happen quite a few times, but a solid cast including the entertaining Kevin Durand and Kathryn Newton, some quickly paced direction and some pithy writing keeps most of this moving along with the diverse range of characters (and intellects) making for quite an enjoyable romp in a sort of ""Cluedo"" with loads of ketchup style. Who knew red onions were so versatile?",7.0
1111873,Abigail,"Abigail isn't exactly a novel idea but its executed convincingly enough to offer up a moderately watchable, horror, experience.

In spite of its grounding in vampiric horror, I didn't find Abigail especially frightening. There's no sense of creeping menace and frankly, that's a shame. It does ""have a go"", so to speak, at first but never really takes it far enough or handles the material subtly enough, to pull it off.

Instead, Abigail is more in line with you standard vampire fare, where for the majority of the film you know who and what, you are dealing with. This tends to move the narrative and exposition, more towards a bloody action framework. 

This film is not unwatchable, don't get me wrong. The acting is decent, the setting appropriately creepy and the horror sequences are polished. That said, I did find myself feeling like I'd seen it all before, in one sense or another.The ending fizzes when it could have ""popped"", too.

In summary, Abigail's handling feels like a missed opportunity to do something far more terrifying and creepily menacing, than what we get with the actual final product. Not bad but nothing special.",6.0
1111873,Abigail,"Boy did this one catch me by surprise! I absolutely loved watching <em>'Abigail'</em>! An unexpected gem!

I knew nothing pre-watch aside from that it was classed, on Wikipedia at least, as horror, so was simply expecting the usual fare à la <em>'Imaginary'</em> and/or <em>'Immaculate'</em> (former bad, latter good fwiw). Clearly, what I in fact saw knocked my socks off! I had a tremendous amount of fun with every second of this, it's unsettling as it is amusing... every department did a grand job!

Not even sure where to start with my list of many positives. Alisha Weir is the star of the whole thing, what an utterly brilliant performance from the youngster - so damn convincing, particularly early on. Melissa Barrera is also outstanding, I previously found her fairly forgettable in <em>'Scream'</em> but here I undeniably liked watching her act. Dan Stevens (another I've found 'meh' elsewhere) impresses as well, as does Kathryn Newton. Heck, everyone onscreen is great.

I love how they showed the bloody (and the blood in general) body implosions, great use of (I assume) practical and special effects - proper thrilled me each time. I was happy to see the film get straight into the plot too, no messing about. It does a good job after that opening portion in setting up the characters before the mess truly hits the fan, which is when the movie seriously clicks into gear. Everything from that point on was an absolute blast - quite literally, eh?!

Going back to that opening few scenes, I was actually a touch concerned when it went from the initial fun escape to a one-location dynamic; I thought that was going to slow it down and make it more in keeping with the vibes of those two earlier 2024 movies that I noted at the top of my review. However, each moment in that one location is fantastic to watch, I have zero complaints. It's all paced to perfection!

Almost stunned at how much I enjoyed this, probably because I wasn't expecting anything from it. Looking at my ratings I've just now realised that I weirdly haven't got a favourite horror movie. According to the Letterboxd sort, I haven't even rated any films from this genre at anything above 9/10 - and even with that score it's only nine flicks, none of which I strongly adore. An unnoticed blind spot in my taste is evidently no longer.

The reviews for this seem generally favourable (at worst), which is nice to see. I've seen many online in agreement with me, what a ride! Not that it needs stating, but I'd highly recommend you check this one out!",10.0
1111873,Abigail,"Abigail is a fun, action-driven vampire movie that seamlessly blends good comedy with its supernatural elements and violence. The film offers a delightful mix of thrills and humor, making for an enjoyable viewing experience.

The standout performances in the film elevate its overall impact. Dan Stevens brings a charismatic presence to his role, delivering both action and comedic moments with ease. Melissa Barrera also shines, adding depth to her character with a nuanced performance. However, it is Alisha Weir as the young vampire Abigail who truly steals the show. Her portrayal is both endearing and fierce, capturing the complexities of a young vampire navigating a chaotic world.

It is always a pleasure to see Giancarlo Esposito on screen, and his role in Abigail is no exception. He brings a gravitas to the film that balances the lighter, more chaotic elements. I would have preferred more of his character in the film.

The rest of the cast is a mixed bag of chaotic characters that fit well within the tone of this horror comedy. While some characters are more memorable than others, they collectively contribute to the film’s energetic and unpredictable atmosphere. 

The comedy in Abigail is well-timed and effectively breaks up the tension of the action scenes. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, allowing for playful moments that enhance its entertainment value. The twists, while not entirely unexpected, are executed with enough flair to keep the audience invested. For example, a late-film revelation about Abigail's origins adds an intriguing twist to the narrative, adding depth to her character and setting up potential future installments.",6.0
1111873,Abigail,"Not quite as entertaining as Ready or Not, still has plenty of bonker moments, especially the second half. Really liked the performances by Melissa Barrera and Dan Stevens, but the others were a lot of fun as well. **3.5/5**",7.0
1111873,Abigail,"I feel like “Abigail” is going to be one of those horror movies that audiences and genre fans really like. This latest project from Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett has everything you’d want in a film, and it delivers on them all. From its wicked sense of humor and slightly taunting tone to its fully committed, talented cast and plenty of bloody gore, this is one entertaining ride from start to finish.

A menagerie of would-be criminals (Melissa Barrera, Dan Stevens, Kathryn Newton, Kevin Durand, Angus Cloud and William Catlett) have taken a mysterious job at the behest of a man named Lambert (Giancarlo Esposito) to kidnap Abigail (Alisha Weir), the preteen ballerina daughter of a very powerful figure in the underworld. It’s a $50 million ransom and payday, and the gang holes up in a creepy old mansion overnight until her daddy makes with the cash. Nothing goes according to plan, and they’re especially thrown for a loop when they eventually discover that they’re trapped inside not only with no way out, but with a 12-year-old girl who is definitely not normal.

It’s a very simple premise and story, but everyone involved makes the most of it. The film exceeds expectations, and it’s so much better and more satisfying than you’d expect. A lot of that is due to the terrific cast and performances, stylish directing, and a series of genuine surprises and twists that are both shocking and sometimes even silly. (In fact, the story’s surprises are one of the biggest strengths, so avoid all spoilers if you want to have the most fun watching this one).

Another thing that sets the film apart is its unexpectedly well-developed characters. In a genre often filled with simple throwaways, screenwriters Stephen Shields and Guy Busick take the time to flesh out each character, making their backgrounds, struggles, and terror feel real. While the adults are understated for the most part, Weir tends to overdo it a bit in some of the later scenes. Her dramatic (and a little goofy) performance, especially when ballerina dancing is combined with throat-ripping, just screams out “corny horror movie.” But that’s also what makes it all so entertaining.

Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett include a handful of lazy jump scares but never rely on them, which is refreshing. There are plenty of bloody and gross moments that’ll appease fans looking for grisly effects, and even those are played with a lightly farcical touch. I wouldn’t call this film scary, but it’s definitely amusing.

There are some glaring plot holes, so your willingness to look the other way will probably be a major deciding factor if you’ll enjoy or hate this one. It’s a straightforward story, but it’s also clear a lot of effort has been put into every aspect of the movie. “Abigail” knows exactly what it wants to be and delivers on that promise.

1111873,Abigail,"I went into ""Abigail"" expecting a chilling horror movie with a unique ballerina twist, but I was surprised to find it leaning more towards comedy. The exaggerated fight scenes between adults and a young girl provided some comedic moments that had me chuckling.

While the film does explore character development, it unfortunately disposes of two characters without much impact. Despite this flaw, the plot's unexpected twists and turns keep the story engaging and make for an overall enjoyable viewing experience.

The final act may feel a bit chaotic, but the climactic battle scene is reminiscent of classic movie showdowns, adding to the excitement. Melissa Barrera's presence in the film harkens back to her role in the ""Scream"" franchise, evoking a sense of nostalgia.

Unfortunately, the film falters in its conclusion with an unnecessary cameo from the father, disrupting the emotional dynamic of Joey. This misstep detracts from an otherwise entertaining movie.",7.0
1111873,Abigail,"What a great movie...

1111873,Abigail,"ABIGAIL is a stylish, bloody vampire flick that thrives on its energetic performances and slick production quality. Melissa Barrera, Dan Stevens, and Alisha Weir shine in their roles, with Weir in particular proving to be a standout young talent. Matt Bettinelli-Olpin & Tyler Gillett's partnership continues to be incredibly successful, blending humor, action, and horror seamlessly. Really fun atmosphere, making it an entertaining ride from start to finish.

While the film impresses visually and keeps a fast-paced momentum, it lacks depth in its storytelling. The plot feels familiar, sticking closely to vampire genre tropes without much thematic exploration. Yet, for those looking for a light, enjoyable experience with excellent performances and sharp direction, ABIGAIL delivers exactly that. It's not groundbreaking, but it's worth watching for fans of stylish horror.

1111873,Abigail,"**_“And Then There Were None” meets “The Lost Boys” meets Tarantino_**

Several kidnappers take a 12 years-old ballerina captive and hold her at a locked-down mansion until her filthy rich father pays up. But this ain’t no typical little rich girl.

“Abigail” (2024) is amusing horror in the mold of “From Dusk Till Dawn” meshed with ""We Summon the Darkness.” The basic plot is old hat if you consider “The Beast Must Die” from fifty years earlier and ""Howling V: The Rebirth"" from the late 80s. Yet it works well for the first 85 minutes before devolving into splatter horror overkill, like the original “Scream” did.

Interestingly, Elon Musk and Joan Jett are featured in the cast. Not really, but it seems like it (I’m talking about Kevin Durand and Melissa Barrera respectively). Speaking of brunette Barrera, she’s a highlight on the feminine front along with blonde Kathryn Newton.

While not of the caliber of “From Dusk Till Dawn,” it’s superior to ""We Summon the Darkness.”

It was shot in Dublin and is overlong at 1 hour, 49 minutes. They shoulda tightened it up by shaving off 15-20 minutes.

""Blink Twice marks a promising debut for Zoë Kravitz as a filmmaker, demonstrating that her personal creativity and vision aren't confined to the side of the camera she works on.

Despite some shortcomings in tone management, the compelling narrative, supported by memorable performances from Ackie, Tatum, and Arjona, and an immersive, unsettling atmosphere, make this psychological thriller an engaging, cathartic experience.

840705,Blink Twice,"Yikes but this is riddled with flaws. ""Frida"" (Naomi Ackie) and her pal ""Jess"" (Alia Shawkat) are working for the caterers at a grand party hosted by gazillionaire ""Slater"" (Channing Tatum). Mid way through the evening, they don their glad rags and join in the party. A little accident gets ""Frida"" introduced to their host and after a few glasses of Champagne, the two are thick as thieves. His chief of staff, ""Vic"" (Christian Slater) needs to go somewhere warm so he can have a drink with an umbrella in it, so they readily accept an invitation from their new-found friend to visit his paradise island where together with a group of his other friends, they will enjoy some sunshine, fine dining and drugs-galore. What's a bit unnerving on this otherwise Elysian estate, is the old woman (María Elena Olivares) who seems to spend her time gathering up some beautiful yellow snakes that roam the place freely but whose venom can be dangerous. It's only when ""Jess"" gets bitten that her friend begins to wonder just what is going on here. It's all just too idyllic, and when the old lady gives her a shot of something to drink that isn't from an hand-blown bottle - well, reality starts to kick in and things take on a much more sinister reality not just for her, but for all of the women going about their days in blissful, powder-induced, ignorance. It's got something of the Agatha Christie meets ""Glass Onion"" to it, this - and for maybe the first half hour is quite intriguing, but once the story gets into gear it just becomes too implausible. Sure, it plays to vanity and the readiness of folks to believe what clearly is too good to be true, but as the story builds to a denouement there is one whopping great Achilles' heel in the premiss that even the occasional presence of his perma-ditzy assistant ""Stacy"" (Geena Davis) can't rescue. It's a good looking drama, but the acting is as unremarkable as the dialogue and though I did quite like the irony of the final conclusion, the plot is just way too thin as we work our way there. This is typical summertime cinema fayre that tries to mix comedy with thriller but in the end just looks like a good excuse for Tatum, Slater et al to have some fun in the sun.",6.0
840705,Blink Twice,"Great movie!

<em>'Blink Twice'</em> manages to create high intrigue, an unsettling tone and is very stylishly put together, eventually showcasing some thoroughly enjoyable and visually pleasing violence towards the end.

The rest of the cast are all good value, especially Adria Arjona.

I'd admit that it isn't the most unique picture, there are remnants of other productions scattered in there - <em>'Don't Worry Darling'</em> for one,  bit of <em>'Glass Onion'</em> as well as basically any Jordan Peele flick. Still, I had a real fun time watching it all unfold on the big screen so I truly can't leave any complaints. Interested to see what Zoë Kravitz does next in the hot seat.",9.0

840705,Blink Twice,"In a surprising turn of events, Channing Tatum takes on a new role in the horror genre in the upcoming thriller ""Blink Twice"". Directed by his girlfriend Zoe Kravitz, this film will have audiences on the edge of their seats, trying to decipher the mystery unfolding on a secluded island where women and a young man have been taken.

The luxurious setting, mouth-watering food, and extravagant hospitality all seem too good to be true, leading to a suspenseful tale that keeps viewers guessing until the very end. Without giving away any spoilers, it's safe to say that the plot is intricately woven, the direction is top-notch, and the climax is sure to leave you speechless with a jaw-dropping twist.

As the story delves into dark and unsettling territory, drawing parallels to real-life events like those surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's island, it becomes clear that ""Blink Twice"" is not just your average thriller. It sheds light on the horrors that can lurk beneath the surface of seemingly idyllic settings, making it a chilling reminder of the dangers that can exist in the shadows.

While the subject matter may be disturbing, the film itself is a well-crafted piece of cinema, skillfully executed and guaranteed to leave a lasting impact on its audience.

840705,Blink Twice,"**""Blink Twice"" and You’ll Miss a Stunning Directorial Debut from Zoë Kravitz**

Zoë Kravitz has officially entered the world of directors with Blink Twice, and her debut is nothing short of brilliant. She reimagines the Final Girl trope in a fresh, bold way, giving us an excellent blend of suspense and smooth storytelling. Kravitz's mastery of narrative pacing and visual tension makes it clear she’s not just dabbling in directing—she’s making waves. This debut film is the perfect example of a director with vision, confidence, and originality.

And then there’s Channing Tatum. WOW! His performance is absolutely jaw dropping, showcasing a range we haven’t often seen from him. Tatum seamlessly moves between charm, vulnerability, and intensity, pulling the audience into every scene. It’s one of his most transformative roles yet, proving he’s more than capable of delivering deeply emotional, dynamic performances.

**The Big Idea: Forgetting vs. Happiness **
Zoë also takes us deeper with her thought-provoking theme of ""Forgetting to Move On."" Rather than promoting the idea that forgetting brings happiness, she questions whether holding onto memories, even painful ones, can make us stronger. It echoes the often misattributed quote: “Happiness is good health and a short memory.” Kravitz challenges that idea, making us think twice about how we process the past.

**KUDOS to Naomi Ackie **
Naomi Ackie delivers a grounded, powerful performance that perfectly complements the film’s intensity. She adds emotional depth to every scene she’s in, capturing the complexities of her character without overplaying it. Ackie’s natural talent shines, and her performance is definitely one to watch.

Simultaneously, the subplot involving two Allied spies embedded within the German ranks adds an exciting layer of espionage. Babs Olusanmokun and Eiza González deliver fantastic performances, navigating the perilous environment with a blend of cunning and bravery. 

However, not all elements of the film work seamlessly. The scenes featuring Winston Churchill are notably weaker, often disrupting the narrative flow and diminishing the film’s intensity. These moments feel out of place, detracting from the otherwise tight and focused storytelling. 

On the technical front, the film excels with masterful cinematography and outstanding sound design. The visual style captures the gritty and chaotic nature of war while maintaining clarity during intense action sequences. The sound design immerses the audience in the film’s world, from the clamor of battle to the subtle tension of stealth operations.

Churchill refuses to surrender to Germany and so backs the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which was the precursor to what is today known as black ops. The unorthodox team carry out Operation Postmaster in early 1942, a daring attack on an island near Cameroon to disrupt the Nazis' U-boat resupply operation.

Helmed by Guy Ritchie, ""The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare"" (2024) is similar in plot to 1968’s “Attack on the Iron Coast,” which covered the St Nazaire Raid on the shore of German-occupied France, a raid that happened to take place 2.5 months after Operation Postmaster. Interestingly, the SOE were considered for heading that raid (in the aftermath of the great success of Operation Postmaster), but the mission was determined to be beyond the capabilities of the small-scale group.

While the plot is reminiscent of “Attack on the Iron Coast,” the ‘hip,’ smirky style is along the lines of Tarantino’s “Inglourious Basterds,” mixed with bits of “The Dirty Dozen” and “Where Eagles Dare.” If you favor those movies, you’ll probably like this one, but it’s the least of ’em IMHO with the exception of the low-budget “Attack on the Iron Coast,” which was shot in B&W.

Don’t get me wrong, this is a top-of-the-line production with a quality cast, including the likes of Henry Cavill, Alan Ritchson, Eiza González and Babs Olusanmokun. It just needed a little more human interest to draw me into the characters and care about the manic events.

""Argylle emerges as a (very) pleasant surprise this new year, blending absurdity with sophistication to create a truly memorable cinematic experience.

Matthew Vaughn's vision, combined with Jason Fuchs' sharp, clever screenplay, provides an entertainment rollercoaster ride that obliterates initial expectations. From unexpected twists and turns to the incredibly charismatic cast, not to mention a third act filled with hilariously unforgettable action set pieces, the complex-made-simple spy story captivates the audience with its campy charm and relentless energy.

848538,Argylle,"""Elly Conway"" (Bryce Dallas Howard) lives in her remote lakeside home writing spy novels that are going down a storm. Her conclusion to the fifth in the series about the eponymous, ""007""-style agent perplexes her mother, though. What happens next? Well wait til book six would seem to be the obvious answer, but mom (Catherine O'Hara) insists so ""Elly"" decides to take train to visit her parents - and that's mistake number one. Onboard she encounters a rather scruffy looking chap ""Wilde"" (Sam Rockwell) who is reading one of her books. She tries to hide her identity, but when he gets to the fly-leaf then her secret is out. That's soon the least of her worries as she and travelling cat ""Alfie"" are soon caught up in something straight out of one of her books! She can't fathom why she'd conceivably be the target for any nasty people, but her new found friend soon convinces her that there is someone she has to meet - and pretty quickly she's embroiled in an whole new world of mystery, intrigue and danger! It's a bit of a slow start this film, with a slightly annoying flicking between her real life and those of her characterisations (that's where the ""Action Man"" style of the sparingly used Henry Cavill appears) but once we establish who is who and what's going on, we are straight into ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" territory with loads of rapid-fire escapades that though hardly original, do have some fun twists and turns as we progress to a denouement that is derivative, but still quite enjoyable to watch. The initial concept is quite original and though the execution largely an amalgam of other Matthew Vaughn features, it still works quite well even if it is far too long, with Rockwell clearly having some fun here and the cat remaining largely contained in it's capsule throughout!",7.0
848538,Argylle,"It’s disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn’s latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that’s trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, “So what’s it going to be?” There’s also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we’ve already seen before in movies like “Romancing the Stone” (1984), “The Long Kiss Goodnight” (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it’s true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there’s a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there’s the picture’s excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. “Argylle” also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn’t quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what’s conveyed in the picture’s video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O’Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn’t nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. “Argylle” apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we’ll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.",5.0

848538,Argylle,"Such a peculiar film. Everything about it feels off.

I was initially a little unsure as to what I thought about <em>'Argylle'</em>, but in the end: it's a no from me. I couldn't actually tell you one thing that I properly liked about this, like at a push Sam Rockwell and Bryan Cranston are decent but even they get a bit hit-and-miss. There's just a constant tinge of lousiness that follows around throughout.

Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, even if she is fairly likeable. Henry Cavill is wooden (intentionally? doubtful), as is Dua Lipa but the musician has enough charm to make it work slightly. Speaking of music, all that is used here is alright but again feels off - mostly seems like the correct type of song, just the wrong exact choice of song... ""Electric Energy"" might grow on me, though.

What also doesn't help is the unavoidable feeling that it is a bad redo of <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/films/in/kingsman-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/"" rel=""nofollow"">Kingsman</a>'</em>, which is expected given who directed this and all that they are planning with the two flicks behind the scenes. I'm all for a shared universe, though this is perhaps too on the nose. There are also <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lost-city-2022/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Lost City</a>'</em> (itself echoing <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/nims-island/"" rel=""nofollow"">Nim's Island</a>'</em>) vibes sprinkled in too. Another negative is the special effects, especially at the start... less said, the better.

Overall, I think it all boils down to being a poor film - unfortunately, as I kinda wanted to like it but simply couldn't. Actually, it's just come to me, I just remembered a scene I actually did truly enjoy: the one with Leona Lewis' ""Run"" track. That was actually entertaining.",5.0

Love Dallas in most things but in this she was fine as the author character but so unbelievable as the action spectacular spy. Sam Rockwell was great, as usual and the rest did a serviceable job but the story was horribly executed. The colorful, smoke bomb, ballet gunfire gauntlet scene was absurd. And what's with the repetitive use of the new Beatles tune? Didn't fit and slowed the action down. And the use of Henry Cavill and John Cena was confusing, silly and not needed. Promising beginning that crashed and burned. ",4.0

1041613,Immaculate,"Now I did quite like the underlying premiss of this take on the immaculate conception but boy, the execution and the acting are something completely different. ""Cecilia"" (Sydney Sweeney) is taken to a beautifully rustic convent where she is welcomed with open arms. Everyone says how pretty and blessed she is, and this rather flies in the face of her natural humility. Imagine her shock, then, when she is summoned to the cardinal (Giorgio Colangeli) and made to undergo some rather personal medical tests that reveal.... Well that'd be telling, and for a while Michael Mohan manage to sustain a little interest in just what is going on amidst the peace and quiet of this ancient sanctuary. Sadly, though, the story swiftly goes way off the rails and leaves us exposed to Sweeney's limited talents and an excess of hysteria that involves a chicken, a dimly lit catacomb and a dastardly plan that puts enormous strain on our increasingly inventive and resilient novice. As ""Yoda"" might have profoundly said, ""loads of screaming and ketchup do not an horror film make"" and after about half an hour here the writing is on the wall (perhaps the best place for it?) and my interest wained. This is a tough genre to keep interesting - there are few ideas that have not been done to death before. This has the germ of originality, but sadly it's a very small germ.",6.0

I think I wanted more from <em>'Immaculate'</em>, though what's provided is fairly watchable to be honest. Visually it looks neat, too. Sydney Sweeney's performance is as good as expected, the rest of the cast are all competent; Álvaro Morte the standout of them.

The run time does fly by, I kinda felt watching that there wasn't really a middle - just one long build-up to the main event at the end. Speaking of which, 'the' scene at the conclusion made me smirk, the problem is that it most certainly was not supposed to; Cecilia's screams immediately sounded like that ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/ee925OTFBCA?si=s8NzVt0U6AX4jEg5&t=13"" rel=""nofollow"">best cry ever</a>"" meme* to me, I couldn't help but smile, I'm sorry.

<em>*never knew the backstory to that clip until searching for it here, it's not quite so amusing now to be honest. awks.</em>

Immaculate brings nothing new to the table. There is not a single original idea here, almost every scene or idea has been done before in countless other movies. It copied everything that has been done before and did it without soul. Two exceptions though: First, the very last scene was somewhat intense but the conclusion did not make sense in my opinion. Second, the visuals are well made and often beautiful.

Being this unimaginative, the movie could have increased its entertainment value going the obvious route and show some nudity - Sydney Sweeney and the other nuns have lots to offer in this regard. There is none though, except some slightly transparent bathing gowns. I mean, if you can't write properly, at least give us some other excitement.",5.0

A drippy robot named Zoe, that whinges about its pronouns, climate change alarmism with AI that wants to  ""reset"" humanity (heard that before?).

Worse still, this bland, lecturing story, goes nowhere remotely interesting. Its predictable. formulaic fare.

646097,Rebel Ridge,"Unless I'm mistaken, John Boyega was supposed to have the lead role in this but it went to Aaron Pierre instead. I'm glad he got the role cause I really liked him in it. I hope we get him in more action roles in the future.

There are three things I quite liked in this, besides the action:

1. We know this guy is meant to be an ex-marine because of the tagline but they make it seem like he's into some shady shit at the beginning of the movie, and no, I don't mean when he was detained at the very start. It was fun.
2. Being a woke AF anti-theist (that's someone opposed to organized religion) I really liked the line: ""I don't know enough about the afterlife to trust in it, so while I'm here, [...] I gotta haunt these motherfuckers myself."" That line was hard.
3. The ending. They were building up to it throughout various scenes and I enjoyed watching it play out. I hope that was sufficiently vague enough to not spoil it.

I initially rated this 8 stars with a favorite, but to offset those irrational 1 star ratings, I'm gonna give it 10. I can understand 5 stars and up, but I can't understand 2 and 1. I'm not a film critic and I'm not racist. I'm just someone who enjoys movies.",10.0
646097,Rebel Ridge,"I waited at least 30 minutes into this tedious affair, wanting something, anything, to happen. When it finally did, it wasn't overly inspiring. Thereafter, it was like a car with a stuck accelerator, start, stop, repeat until the last fourth of this film, when something exciting ""finally"" does  happen. By then, I'll wager many viewers will have simply given up. Guess I'm a naive optimist.....  

Why, why, why can't we have decent scripts, Netflix? Could it be you are too busy woke messaging? One of the characters talks about lynching the main character and the main character, in turn, comments on how the black police officer has an inferior police car, compared to her white counterparts. 

In reality, I do believe there's a genuine problem with policing and not just in the US either. Statistically more white Americans are killed by police every year than black, so its fair to say, its a problem for ""everyone"".

That said, like a lot of people, I look to entertainment to escape the world's misery and divisive politics, not have it thrust in my face, over and over again.  

In summary, on first inspection, Rebel Ridge, has all the hallmarks of an updated Rambo style action flick backed by a strong cast. I was genuinely excited, until I saw the final, dull, lecturing product. 


",4.0
646097,Rebel Ridge,"At its core, Rebel Ridge is a familiar story: a lone hero against a corrupt system. Yet, Saulnier's deft direction and a strong, well-developed narrative set this film apart. The film begins with a seemingly simple premise: a former Marine, Jeremiah Carter (Pierre), returns to his hometown to help his cousin post bail. However, a series of unfortunate events leads to a confrontation with the local police department, which quickly escalates into a full-blown rebellion against the town's corrupt power structure.

Pierre delivers a tour-de-force performance as Jeremiah Carter. His portrayal of a man driven to desperation by injustice is both powerful and heartbreaking. Carter is a complex character, a man haunted by his past who is forced to confront the darkness within himself to protect those he loves. Pierre's physicality and intensity are matched only by his ability to convey a deep emotional vulnerability.

Rebel Ridge is a film that feels incredibly timely. The themes of police brutality, systemic racism, and the abuse of power are explored with a raw honesty that is both disturbing and cathartic. Saulnier's direction is unflinching, capturing the violence and brutality of the film's world without resorting to gratuitous gore.

While the film's pacing may feel a bit uneven at times, the final act is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion. The film's climax is a tense and suspenseful showdown that has you on the edge of your seat. The film's ending is both hopeful and tragic, a bittersweet reminder of the enduring power of the human spirit.

Rebel Ridge is a powerful and thought-provoking film that deserves to be seen. It is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Aaron Pierre's performance is nothing short of extraordinary, and Jeremy Saulnier's direction is masterful. If you are a fan of gritty thrillers with a strong social message, Rebel Ridge is a must-see.",7.0

As the story continues we begin to suspect that it's not just him that needs an ""IF"". Sure, it's derivative at times, but there's an engaging effort from the young Fleming and the sparing use of the colourful and well integrated visual effects along with some cheery scripting and a few amiable supporting characters that could easily inhabit any toy-box (I liked the bear and the tasting marshmallow) wired well. Also, Reynolds takes enough of a back seat not to impose his presence too firmly on the proceedings.

The film, written and directed by Krasinski, aims to be kind of like a live action ""Monsters, Inc"". It's really an idea that can only work in animation since it takes out that sense of reality that makes it look too silly. The plot just seems like an idea that has difficulty finding a believable footing.

639720,IF,"IF promised an intriguing premise but unfortunately fell short of delivering a compelling narrative. The film heavily relies on celebrity cameos, which, overshadow the story's substance. This overreliance on star power creates a superficial experience that fails to engage the audience meaningfully.

The movie attempts to pull on the heartstrings of the audience, but it does so without a satisfying payoff. Emotional scenes feel forced and unearned, lacking the depth necessary to make a lasting impact. 

The narrative structure is weak. The pacing is uneven, jumping from one celebrity cameo to another without allowing the plot to develop naturally. This results in a fragmented viewing experience that leaves the audience struggling to connect with the characters. 

The film's attempt to evoke emotion through its storyline falls flat because it doesn’t give enough attention to character development. We see glimpses of potentially interesting backstories, but they are never fully explored. A scene involving a character’s past trauma is introduced but quickly abandoned, leaving the audience with unanswered questions and a sense of incompleteness.

Overall, IF is a movie that misses the mark. Its reliance on celebrity cameos and superficial emotional appeals results in a lackluster film.

""IF"" is a solid, well-made film with some great ideas, but it doesn’t fully explore the potential it sets up. It’s clearly aimed at a younger audience, which is fine, but the simplicity of the plot and the way certain moments are handled left me wanting more depth. There are scenes in which the movie tries to make feel urgent but falls flat and doesn’t carry the weight it should. They felt rushed, and that’s a feeling I had throughout much of the movie.

The film has a charming fantasy element that could have been expanded to create something truly magical, but instead, it skims the surface. The pacing is quick, and while that might work for kids, I was hoping for a bit more exploration and development of the ideas presented.

The acting, however, is a bright spot. The cast does a great job with their roles, bringing humor and warmth to the film. Steve Carell as Blue was especially a standout, delivering a performance that was both funny and heartfelt. I just wish we had more of John Krasinski himself, as his presence always adds something special.

Overall, ""IF"" is a good movie—entertaining, sweet, and funny—but it left me wanting more. It’s worth a watch, especially if you’re in the mood for something light and family-friendly, but don’t expect it to go beyond that.",7.0

I will say that it does set the tone early on nicely (up until the introduction of Blossom & Co.) and concludes with some heart, though everything in-between is underwhelming. The voice cast includes Phoebe Waller-Bridge (who voices the aforementioned) and a fair few other known names, though only Steve Carell (minorly) stood out to me to be honest.

Cailey Fleming does well in the lead role, I already admire her acting due to her time on 'The Walking Dead' - I wish we got more of her as Judith, in fact. Ryan Reynolds - someone I tend to enjoy - feels miscast, I'm all for seeing him play against type but it's just that his character doesn't really do enough to warrant having that sorta actor.

The two start a romantic relationship in a sea of deception and moral ambiguity, which changes Gary’s life forever.

It’s a great premise for a film, but Linklater just can’t make it work. While he admittedly isn’t one of my favorite directors, he completely misses the mark here. The narrative is disjointed and the tonal inconsistencies are too jarring, and no amount of talent can balance the uneven, overstuffed elements of comedy, romance, and thriller. The film struggles on just about every level, but thankfully Powell saves it from being completely unwatchable.

Powell is the highlight here. His charm and versatility shines as he navigates the complex layers of his character. This is an actor who is a true chameleon, and the film at least provides a vehicle where he can showcase his range. Powell is great; the movie is not.

Linklater introduces a lot of bland melodrama with the relationship between Gary and Madison and, despite a believable chemistry, it causes the film to stumble even more. With her character’s motivations being murky at best, it was impossible to feel fully invested in Madison’s relationship with Gary’s alter-ego, Ron.

For a film that had the potential to be so unique, it ends up feeling generic and unsatisfying. Despite having a small theatrical release, “Hit Man” is a disappointing effort that appropriately feels right at home as a streaming title on Netflix.

974635,Hit Man,"Hit Man by Richard Linklater is a solid watch, blending a deliberate pace with engaging character work. The first act feels like it lingers a little too long, but by the time the final act rolls around, you realize it was all intentional. That slower setup creates a nice payoff later, making the transitions between acts smooth and well-timed. It’s clear Linklater knew exactly how much breathing room to give the story, even if it left me wishing for a bit more energy upfront.

Glen Powell and Adria Arjona carry the film with their performances, delivering exactly what their roles demand without overdoing it. Their character arcs extend nicely into the second act, which keeps things interesting and makes you care about what happens next. The plot itself isn’t groundbreaking and leans on some predictability, but it seems like Linklater aimed to keep things simple, possibly to avoid overwhelming the audience. Still, a touch more depth in the story wouldn’t have hurt.

Visually and musically, the film doesn’t go above and beyond, but it also doesn’t drop the ball. The cinematography and score do their job without overshadowing the narrative. Overall, Hit Man may not wow you on every front, but it’s an enjoyable and well-crafted movie that knows its strengths and sticks to them. It’s the kind of film where the characters and pacing shine more than the visuals or complexity, making it a worthwhile experience.",7.0
1086747,The Watchers,"A real disappointment.

<em>'The Watchers'</em> holds some promise with its premise, though unfortunately it never really clicks into gear - in my opinion, at least. In fact, the longer it went on the more bored I felt whilst watching. I was waiting for the arrival of the end credits, which I thought were coming after 'the event' seemingly ends... yet the film still goes on for a little while yet.

No-one on the cast did anything that could save this, either. Olwen Fouéré is decent, her character starts off fairly interestingly but by the conclusion I didn't really care for her either. The only positive I have for this 2024 flick is the score, which actually is quite good. Aside from that, this Ishana Night Shyamalan directorial debut underwhelmed me a lot, sadly.",5.0
1086747,The Watchers,"Now my Irish geography isn't brilliant, but even I know that to drive from Galway to Belfast takes about four hours and does not involve any forest tracks. Nevertheless, pet shop worker ""Mina"" (Dakota Fanning), who is still coming to terms with a not very recent tragedy, sets off with her rare yellow bird only for her car to break down in the middle of an ancient forest. With no phone reception, she decides to leave her car and taking the caged bird with her, proceeds to wander through the trees shouting help! Pointless? Well no, as it happens, because she luckily encounters ""Madeline"" (Olwen Fouéré) who lives in a large concrete bunker with ""Daniel"" (Oliver Finnegan) and ""Ciara"" (Georgina Campbell). It appears that they have all been stranded in the woods and take shelter after sunset from the ""watchers"". These are mysterious creatures who like to come and watch their guests, via a great big one-way mirror, for a while each night. ""Mina"" is determined to escape and with the help of ""Daniel"" reckons she has a plan, but this just irritates their captors to the point that their ""coup"" is no longer safe. Hey, but wait - there's a submarine hatch in the floor, and when they go down they discover a lot more about who their enemy are, what they want and just who built this equivalent of a nuclear fall out shelter under the trees. Can they use this information to escape the trap and make it to freedom? At times it is quite menacing with their dark and wooded surroundings adding a degree of malevolence to an antagonist that we never really see and whose Gaelic mythological provenance is disappointingly undercooked. It has a go at ending a few times, but then comes back to add a little more to signal what I thought was that there'll be a sequel along shortly, rather than finish the adventure completely. It's not terrible, and Fanning delivers adequately - as does the gorgeous yellow bird, but you'll never remember it.",6.0
1086747,The Watchers,"The Watchers marks Ishana Night Shyamalan's directorial debut, with her father, M. Night Shyamalan, serving as a producer. For her first feature film, Ishana adapts the book The Watcher into a movie. The story centers on Mina, a U.S. immigrant living in Ireland, who works at a pet shop. She is sent to the countryside to make a delivery, only to find herself stranded in the middle of a forest. Seeking refuge, she discovers an old building with three walls and a window. She meets three other people who inform her that she cannot leave because 'The Watchers' are always watching and keeping them there.

The visual style of the film is impressive, showcasing Ishana Night Shyamalan's potential as a director. The atmospheric setting of the forest and the eerie, partially ruined building effectively create a sense of isolation and tension. 

Despite its strong visual elements, the story itself falls short. The plot feels longer than necessary, with certain elements that don’t always make sense. The pacing drags in places, causing the suspense to wane rather than build.

The acting is another weak point. The performances come across as stale, with characters making choices that often seem illogical and uninspired. Mina’s interactions with the other stranded individuals lack depth and emotional resonance, making it hard to connect with her plight. The other characters also fail to leave a lasting impression, contributing to the overall sense of disengagement.

The themes of isolation and surveillance have the potential to be compelling, but they are not fully realized in this film. The concept of being constantly watched by an unseen force could have been used to create a more intense psychological thriller. However, the execution falls flat, resulting in a narrative that feels disjointed and unconvincing.

Overall, The Watchers is a visually striking film that ultimately fails to resonate on a deeper level. While Ishana Night Shyamalan shows promise as a director with her ability to create atmosphere and tension, the film is let down by weak performances, a disjointed story, and lackluster character development. It’s a forgettable film that doesn’t leave a lasting impact. However, I am looking forward to seeing Ishana’s next directorial outing, hoping she can build on her strengths and deliver a more cohesive and engaging film in the future.",4.0
1086747,The Watchers,"Has some interesting elements here and there but despite some decent direction by Ishana Night Shyamalan (daughter of M.

698687,Transformers One,"After the original orgasmatron, we find ourselves back at the very start of the transformer's history with all of the ""Prime"" contraptions having been destroyed in a war and now only ""Sentinel Prime"" exists to lead the bots in a self-perpetuating existence of mining for the fuel that allows them to continue to mine for the fuel. You get the drift. Many of the robots don't have the cogs in their chests necessary to do any transforming, and that includes the lively ""Orion Pax"", his pal ""D-16"" and their feisty supervisor ""Elita-1"", but when a series of incidents occur that sees them escape from their mine onto the forbidden surface they discover an whole new truth that questions not just the history that's been drummed into them, but the very integrity of their leadership. Thing is, can they do anything to thwart a dastardly plan the could ensure the bots stay slaves for ever? As origin stories go, this is one of the better ones. Plenty of action throughout sets a story that doesn't rely (too heavily) on your knowledge of the Hasbro universe, it just allows you to root for the good guys as they battle the menacing and overwhelming forces lined up against them to ensure the new status quo endures and the dead stay exactly that. The story deals with the usual aspects of brotherhood, loyalty, ambition and though there's little actual jeopardy throughout - and, less face it, it's part of an ongoing franchise that's going to run, and run, and run - there's plenty to enjoy as it sets the scene for what's to come. It probably does need a cinema screening to get the best from the grand scale animation and visual effects, and the story and characterisations are not half bad, either.",7.0
698687,Transformers One,"Transformers One is an animated origin story that offers a fresh take on the beloved franchise. My experience watching it was quite enjoyable, as the film combines stunning visuals with a heartfelt narrative that resonates with both new and longtime fans.

The voice acting is exceptional, bringing depth to characters like Optimus Prime and Megatron. The animation is visually striking, enhancing the action sequences while also allowing for moments of genuine emotional connection. I appreciated how the film explores themes of loyalty, leadership, and compassion, which adds layers to the story beyond just robot battles.

However, while the film is accessible and entertaining, I found that it might not satisfy hardcore fans seeking a deeper lore or complexity. The plot is straightforward, with the Matrix of Leadership serving as a central McGuffin, which may feel simplistic for some viewers.

Overall, Transformers One successfully blends action and emotion, making it a must-see for those looking for an engaging family film. It left me feeling optimistic about the future of the franchise, appealing to both a new generation and nostalgic fans alike.

698687,Transformers One,"<em>'Transformers One'</em> is pretty cool. I found it really interesting to see the origin story of how Optimus Prime and Megatron became what they became. Chris Hemsworth and Brian Tyree Henry are perfect for those aforementioned roles, Henry particularly impresses as the latter.

Keegan-Michael Key, Scarlett Johansson and Jon Hamm manage to standout too, I'd say this definitely has the best performing cast of the Michael Bay-involved flicks from this series (I'm aware this is not officially part of the live-action franchise, but with Bay attached it practically is).

The animation style is terrific, there are some gorgeous visuals in there; the backdrops, specifically. The score is also noteworthy, as is the humour actually; Key, though not exclusively, is naturally at the forefront of that department. I don't have complaints with this film, evidently.",8.0

1001311,Sous la Seine,"Under Paris is rather ridiculous French Jaws wannabe. 

Whilst this production is loaded down with the predictable woke tropes I've come to expect from Netflix productions, what really caught my attention was how idiotically implausible the story is. 

In the opening scene a group of male divers is tasked with investigating predation at a oceanic rubbish site, that's ensnared dolphins and other dead, sea life.  Sharks soon turn up leading to the presence of a  female shark, the scientific group have been monitoring.Inexplicably the shark has essentially doubled in size, leading their all knowing female boss to ask the divers to take ""a sample"" from the monster for study, rather than following the sane and reasonable path of fleeing in terror. Predictably, the shark doesn't take this treatment too well and eats the divers. At this point our intrepid female lead having just witnessed the horrific attacks on her research ships monitors, dives into the water, to confront the monster with a spear gun, that would hardly scare a large Tuna. 

Without spoiling things for those who want to watch this, it doesn't get any better from here on in. Really if you are going to make a film of this kind, is it truly that hard to make it, at least, a little believable? 

The acting is alright, as are the action sequences but the sense of ""terror"" found in Jaws is largely absent. The key ingredient that drives, what is essentially a monster movie, forward. 

In summary, sinks beneath its own unbelievable story and  bland exposition. If you really want a oceanic monster film, try Jaws instead.",5.0
1001311,Sous la Seine,"Diving headfirst into the genre with all the enthusiasm fans could hope for, the horror / disaster film “Under Paris” is sometimes campy and often ridiculous, but also stands out as a solid entry in the niche of killer shark flicks. It may not be a great film by conventional standards, but this one is not going to disappoint with its willingness to take the premise everywhere fans of creature feature cinema will want it to go.

Set in current day, the city of Paris is getting ready to host the World Triathlon Championships on the Seine. They’re expecting a large number of athletes to compete by swimming in the famous river, but there’s a big, big problem. Sophia (Bérénice Bejo), a brilliant marine scientist with a tragic past, learns from environmental activist Mika (Léa Léviant) that there is a large shark living deep in the river. In order to avoid a literal bloodbath, they join forces with the Seine river police commander Adil (Nassim Lyes) to stop the potential carnage.

It’s actually a pretty great premise, even if the science behind the narrative is (mostly) laughably implausible. While entertaining, the story gets bogged down under its over-the-top ecological messaging. The film is preachy about global warming and how humans are the real enemy, so much so that it can sometimes feel like it’s a project sponsored by Greenpeace. But there’s something admirable about director Xavier Gens‘ commitment to his message, and it adds a layer of sincerity to what is a creatively dumb premise.

The movie strikes a nice balance between classic horror and a disaster story, bridging the two in a satisfying way. It has its dumb B-movie moments (including corny, stating-the-obvious dialogue like “There are sharks in Paris!“), but Gens avoids the outright stupidity of franchises like “Sharknado.” It’s absurd, but also delivers plenty of suspense and thrills.

The action scenes are a mixed bag, with effects that feel very low budget. There’s a goofy shark fin that sticks out of and races through the river, and murky underwater shots dilute much of the action. But there are also bloody, gruesome shark attacks that seem very realistic, and the makeup department has created horrific images straight out of a nightmare.

If you can stick with the slower parts of “Under Paris,” you’re going to be rewarded with a surprisingly great ending. Dumb yet creative, preachy yet thrilling, the movie takes its outlandish premise to all the places that fans of the genre will appreciate.

1001311,Sous la Seine,"Under Paris is one of those movies that tries to be profound but ends up feeling hollow. The story is weak, offering little to no meaningful takeaway, and the characters don’t evolve in any way that makes you care about them. It feels like the filmmakers had a vague idea of what they wanted to achieve, but the execution completely missed the mark. The pacing is uneven, with scenes dragging on unnecessarily, and the overall narrative lacks cohesion.

Visually, the movie has its moments. The cinematography captures some striking shots, and there’s an attempt to create tension through dramatic imagery. However, even these moments feel empty without a solid story or relatable characters to back them up. It’s a case of style over substance, where flashy visuals try to mask the lack of depth, but they don't succeed.

In the end, Under Paris doesn’t leave you with much. It’s not entertaining enough to be memorable or thought-provoking enough to spark conversation. If you’re looking for a movie with compelling storytelling or emotional weight, this isn’t it. It’s a one-and-done kind of watch that leaves you wondering what the filmmakers were even trying to say.",2.0

969492,Land of Bad,"Land of Bland as I call it, is yet another uninspiring, production line, pro US military, action flick.

Coming kitted out with the usual pro US exceptionalism and bad guys who have a valid point about imperialism but are still ""bad"" anyway, this film offers nothing even remotely original or in this reviewers opinion, terribly likeable.

The characters are your usual array of entitled, obnoxious, US military types, who go on a flawed escapade in someone else's country to retrieve a CIA asset. Things turn sour and well the rest is your by the book, bravado, darning do, bravery, codswallop.

Fight scenes are frenetic, well paced and impressive. Lots of pyrotechnics and slow motion bullet and shell casing shots.Certainly from an exposition point of view, this film is not dull. 

Acting is unremarkable but its the story that really leaves a lot to be desired. Putting aside its predictable bias, this tale is cliched, pedestrian and utterly predictable. Its essentially, every stale, second rate, US military action flick, you have ever seen with Australians and New Zealanders, in the lead.

The villain doesn't have a great performance either but that's mostly due to poor writing, they could've done something far greater than her. But the creativity that's present is short lived if it's constantly followed by a villain saying a poor landing joke, or even a main character.

549509,The Brutalist,"Pursuing the American Dream is an ambition of almost every immigrant who manages to make it to this country’s shores. Its realization can take many forms, too, depending on one’s circumstances. But, as many new arrivals discover for themselves, there’s no guarantee of success (or, at the very least, they may find that the journey can be more problematic than anticipated). One such story that provides the focus for this optimistic undertaking is the latest offering from writer-director Brady Corbet. The film follows the odyssey of László Tóth (Adrien Brody), a fictional Jewish Hungarian architect who flees Europe in 1947 after being interred in a concentration camp during World War II. He initially struggles to assimilate, to re-establish his career, and to find a way to bring his wife, Erzsebét (Felicity Jones), to America. But, despite these sundry challenges, his fortunes change drastically when he’s commissioned to design a high-profile mixed use community center with the generous support of a wealthy and powerful benefactor, a capricious, enigmatic industrialist (Guy Pearce) whose many impulsive, emotionally charged whims provide László with a firsthand introduction to the many possibilities and pitfalls tied to that elusive American Dream. In telling this story, the filmmaker explores the ups and downs associated with these themes, as well as an array of additional diverse story threads involving the protagonist’s professional pursuits and personal life. These combined elements make for an engaging and intriguing tale, even if some of the story arcs and character traits are unevenly developed. That sometimes includes the nature of László himself, which is somewhat perplexing given the production’s hefty 3:35:00 runtime (with an included intermission), a duration that should provide ample time for the picture to sufficiently flesh out its core narrative elements and character attributes. That shortcoming aside, though, “The Brutalist” has myriad strengths to its credit, including the fine performances of Pearce, Jones, Golden Globe Award winner Brody and a host of capable supporting players, along with its superb cinematography, stirring original score, and ably sustained pacing (quite a commendable feat for a film of this length). Admittedly, this offering’s solid opening act is far superior to its back half, which tends to sag at times as it wears on, but, on balance, this Golden Globe winner for best drama and best director generally holds up well. In an awards season that has had more than its share of dismal disappointments, it’s heartening to finally find a release that comes closer to approaching the standards that a film should embody to merit the kinds of accolades and attention such honorees truly deserve. It may not be perfect, but it’s a far sight better than many of its other 2024 cinematic peers.",8.0

As far as it goes, though, it features a stunning performance from Adrien Brody as fictional Hungarian architect ""Tóth"" who has manages to survive some torrid wartime experiences in Europe and make it to New York. He has family there, and that's the conduit to a meeting with the wealthy ""Van Buren"" (Guy Pearce) who decides that he wants him to design a public utility building - think Hearst Castle only without any style or shape to it. Indeed the title could very well be applied to his fascist style of bleak and angular artistry, but his new benefactor is prepared to commit £850,000 to the project so he's delighted. That's clearly to the chagrin  of ""Harry"" (How Alwyn) whose role here is that of a meddlesome provoker as he he constantly tries to intervene between the architect and his father. ""Van Buren"" senior also manages to facilitate his repatriation with wife (Felicity Jones) and her niece ""Zsófia"" (Raffey Cassidy) but that doesn't quite go to plan either, and soon seems to further pile on the increasing misery for a ""Tóth"" who is treading on eggshells on all fronts now as he tries to build his charm-free edifice. The centrepiece of this is to be an altar stone, and for that he and his boss travel to the mountains of Carrara, rarely seen in film since Charlton Heston saw the ceiling of the Sistine in the clouds there. Here something shocking happens that ultimately changes the whole dynamic of that relationship and of the film itself. It's this last twenty minutes that I felt saw the wheels come off. The thrust of the story throughout appears to emphasise the man and his family as outsiders. As them being a means to an end and little better than a commodity to be used and abused as one of the ""Van Buren"" men see fit, but the drunken violence that concludes the story seems excessively designed to disgust for the sake to it. Why? I didn't get it, nor the consequent denouement. It's also interesting that much is being made of the VistaVision angle. That which put so many from Humphrey Bogart to John Wayne on the big screen decades ago now appears to have been ""rediscovered"" as if it were revelatory. Well it might help the photography, but not the story - and that begins to run out steam before the unnecessary (from a plot perspective) intermission. Part one offers a compelling look at obsession and the odious nature of patronage and hypocrisy. Part two isn't nearly so good, is more soapy and far less substantial - there is plenty going on but none of the threads really get the attention they need to make them interesting, or to ant them together cohesively. Brady Corbet has one hell of an imagination but perhaps this needed a more objective, and judicious, hand at the tiller. It's good, but it's not anything like as good as it's being hyped up to be. A big screen is essential, though. It will look depressingly ordinary on the television.",7.0
549509,The Brutalist,"This movie is excellent. Beautiful. Good story. Funny stuff. Drama. Twists and turns. Despite all that excellence, the best feature of this film is the fact that you could turn it off and come back to it the next day when the intermission pops up.",8.0
549509,The Brutalist,"The Brutalist is a slow-burn period drama that dives deep into the personal struggles of an immigrant protagonist driven by artistic ambition, trying to belong in a systematically adverse society. Through a mesmerizing, award-worthy performance by Adrien Brody, the filmmaker Brady Corbet focuses on the character's journey - navigating discrimination, family estrangement, and drug addiction - which is a compelling, intimate study of resilience.

The architectural backdrop of a landmark institution being constructed serves as the main narrative that, while visually stunning through Lol Crawley's impeccable cinematography, ultimately fails to hold the same weight as the personal story, despite the evident parallelisms and metaphors. Daniel Blumberg's immersive score adds a layer of tension, creating an emotional undercurrent that enhances the viewing experience despite the slow pacing.

The three-hour-and-a-half runtime can feel like a test of patience at times, especially with certain moments feeling repetitive or redundant. However, The Brutalist ultimately justifies its length, with the intermission offering a much-needed break in the otherwise epic storytelling. Personally, I feel like I'm in the minority on the positive side as I don't feel as blown away or impressed by the movie, but it's definitely a must-watch film of 2024.

Rating: B",7.0
549509,The Brutalist,"<em>'The Brutalist'</em> is simply outstanding. The biggest compliment I can pay it is that the run time of 215 minutes (!) comes and goes in a flash, the interval at ~1h 40m hit me like a brick! It's a perfect example of not overthinking run times, as long as what's onscreen is good it'll fly by.

I'm not going to be able to add anything fresh to it what has already been lauded about this film, all I can say is that every inch of praise is unequivocally warranted. In regards to the Oscars, I agree that <em>'Anora'</em> smashed it out of the park greater but it's a close run thing. Two spectacular movies!

Adrien Brody's performance is indeed sensational, he is an actor I've seen in bits down the years and have always been impressed so I loved be able to see him act front and centre in such a grand, tremendously made picture. He nails every part of László Tóth. I couldn't imagine any other actor in the role.

Guy Pearce is also a brilliant performer here, obviously <em>'Momento'</em> remains his best work (that I've seen, anyway) but this is the greatest I've seen from Pearce away from that Christopher Nolan flick. He is superb! Joe Alwyn and Felicity Jones merit praise too. Nice to see Jonathan Hyde, as well.

I don't think there is anything about this film that you could truly say is bad. The cinematography is particularly awesome, so is the score, the editing and practically every other detail. It's a quality piece of filmmaking. The first half is stronger than the second, but it's negligible.",10.0
280180,Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F,"Beverly Hills Flop Broken Axel is yet another attempt to cash in on a veteran franchise, that simply doesn't work. 

Whilst all the trapping are there, including Eddie Murphy, who has aged well, much else hasn't. The cheeky, outlandish antics of the original films, is replaced with the usual woke(DEI) hand wringing, whinging and whining. 

The daughter character, in particular, is intensely irritating. She takes empowerment and daddy issues, to a sour faced, new level, dampening down any sense of humour and fun, that could have been derived from this film. 

And that's essentially what the Beverly Hills Cop films from the 80's were, action mixed with zany, out there comedy, that showcased Murphy's quick fire intellect and wit. A lighter version, of the Lethal Weapon series, from the same era but much in the same vein. Certainly not a back drop, for heavy handed, biased, social moralising.

In summary, Eddie Murphy is as likeable as ever but so much else about this film isn't, its hard to say nice things. The incessant need to push ""the message"" takes something that should be fun and lighthearted and buries it beneath heavy morose layers of lecturing. My advice, watch the original films instead.",5.0
280180,Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F,"To say that I was excited for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is an understatement. This is without a doubt one of my favorite franchises of all time, even including the less impressive third film. I thoroughly enjoyed this fourth installment, which sees an older Axel Foley back in Beverly Hills working a case. This time, he is up against cartels, corrupt cops, and more, led by Kevin Bacon, who threatens his daughter Jane, a Beverly Hills defense attorney.

In this film, Axel teams up with a young detective, Bobby, who is also Jane’s ex-boyfriend, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The return of franchise favorites Judge Reinhold as Billy Rosewood, John Ashton as John Taggert, Bronson Pinchot as Serge, and Paul Reiser as Jeffrey adds a layer of nostalgia that fans will appreciate.

Eddie Murphy effortlessly slips back into the character of Axel Foley, as easily as putting on his Lions varsity jacket. His performance is both charismatic and energetic, reminding us why this character became an icon. Murphy’s ability to blend humor with action is on full display, particularly in scenes where he outsmarts his adversaries with his trademark wit and cunning.

The story is fun and packed with exciting moments, and it also has a surprising amount of heart. The chemistry between the original cast members remains perfect and mixes well with the new additions. Kevin Bacon shines as a formidable antagonist, providing a worthy challenge for Axel and his team. His portrayal of a corrupt, menacing figure adds depth to the film’s conflict.

The cinematography successfully bridges the gritty feel of the first movies with the more stylistic approach of the second. The action sequences are well-executed, although some of the stunts and gags feel a bit over the top. For example, an elaborate chase scene through the streets of Beverly Hills, while thrilling, stretches the bounds of believability. Additionally, the film’s timeline contains some questionable elements that don’t quite align with the previous entries in the series. These inconsistencies, while minor, can be distracting for long-time fans.

I appreciated the film’s attempt to incorporate elements from the earlier movies, but I wish Beverly Hills Cop 3 had been integrated more thoughtfully rather than just as a throwaway joke. A more substantial nod to the third film could have added a layer of continuity and depth to the story.

Overall, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is a fun action film that fits well with the recent trend of entertaining action movies released this year. It’s impressive how the film manages to capture the spirit of the original while adding fresh elements to keep the story engaging. Eddie Murphy’s return as Axel Foley is a delight, and the film’s blend of humor, action, and heart makes it a worthy addition to the franchise. Despite some minor flaws, this movie stands out as a testament to why the Beverly Hills Cop series remains beloved by fans.",8.0
280180,Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F,"Let's be honest.... it's not as good as Beverly Hills Cop 3 and that was a mess.

But it's 2024 and by today's super low expectations for quality entertainment is seems like it's a really good movie.

Like the sequel to Coming to America, it sort of forgot that you need a story to work and can't just rely on the characters, and Eddie, he just isn't as quick as he was in I and II... both with the wit and on his feet, so it sort of falters there anyway.

But that is just a comparison.  The fact is that, if you aren't really big Fans of I and II, and if you are and have seen nothing but new movies in the past forever, it's a pretty OK film.

But it's a facade, it only comes across as good because our standards for decent film making are so pathetically low that it makes wrecks like this look amazingly well done, with a Chinatown solid script, great comedic timing, and a solid character arc.

You go back in time before Hollywood fell, and it would be getting all the criticism that came with III.

Leave 80s greats alone, Cobra Kai was the exception not the norm, and you can't capture 80s gold while making it FOR THE MODERN AUDIENCE. With MODERN SENSIBILITIES while removing the humor, characters, and plots that are PROBLEMATIC... because none of that inoffensive cookie cutter crap works today and that goes doubly so for yesteryear.

Once upon a time the good of the Beverly Hills Cop franchise outweighed the bad.  Now it's a wash.  But it's a wash that comes across as good because our expectations are so seriously low.",1.0
280180,Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F,"Action movie. Sequel, universe building.

Seemed to recreate the feel of the old movies. I think Axel only drives old cars. Judge Reinhold's son bangs Eddie's daughter which is kind of like a nod to the sexual tension early in the franchise. Judging from performance, Eddie's will be the one forcing baby judge down on the couch.

Even though I dislike donkey and what became of donkey. I like Eddie Murphy and it's good to see him not being donkey.",8.0
280180,Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F,"“Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” revisits the popular franchise with the expected heavy dose of nostalgia, and thankfully Eddie Murphy‘s enduring charm overpowers the uninspired screenwriting and lackluster storyline. Filled with callbacks, familiar faces, and the iconic soundtrack that defined the 80s, this comfortable journey back to the streets of Beverly hills with the Detroit detective feels tailor-made for fans of the series.

Irreverent detective Axel Foley (Murphy) is back on the beat in the 90210 after his attorney daughter Jane’s (Taylour Paige) life is threatened. A lot of very powerful people want her to back off a case involving some very dirty cops, and she reluctantly works with her estranged dad to get to the bottom of all the threats. Axel teams up with a new local “partner” (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and old pals Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton) for help uncovering what turns out to be a big conspiracy.

It’s a formulaic and predictable plot that still serves as a solid framework for a classic crime story. Murphy effortlessly slips back into Foley’s shoes, delivering the wisecracks with that million dollar charisma that made the character a fan favorite (and himself a certified movie star). It’s fun to see Reinhold and Ashton in action again, but they are mostly there to serve up some additional ‘memberberries. Cast additions Paige and Gordon-Levitt inject some fresh energy into the mix, which, despite their characters both feeling underdeveloped, is more than welcome.

The film takes the nostalgia to the next level, including the overuse of the franchise’s best-selling soundtracks. There are three classic tunes in the opening ten minutes, which feels like a gimmick to get viewers settled into a certain mindset. It works, because this trip through familiar territory is one that relies heavily on the ability of its audience to “just go with it.” Director Mark Molloy delivers what fans expect, from serviceable action sequences, lighthearted humor, and a safe formula that is far from groundbreaking (because it doesn’t need to be).

“Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” is a good enough nostalgia-filled reunion with Murphy’s iconic character. It’s ultimately forgettable, but still provides an enjoyable ride for those looking to revisit old friends and relive the magic of the original films.

280180,Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F,"Recently, I watched ""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F,"" a fresh adaptation and essentially a long-awaited sequel to the original Beverly Hills Cop.

Eddie Murphy truly impressed in his revival of the character, bringing him back to life on the screen, albeit the small screen this time. Despite being a streaming movie, it had the potential to succeed in theaters.

While it may not have been a blockbuster hit, it could have enjoyed some success on the big screen. However, I believe it could have been even more successful. The recasting of the daughter was a letdown for me. Her acting and storytelling towards her father felt forced and insincere, lacking authenticity and depth.

It seemed like the character was neglected in terms of development and emotional depth, which was disappointing. Despite this, the action sequences were thrilling, the storytelling was decent, and the overall plot was reasonably solid.

I wish we had seen more of her involvement in the court case, as that was a central part of the narrative. However, the focus seemed to shift primarily to Eddie Murphy's character, sidelining her story even though it was meant to be significant.

In the end, ""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"" is a decent movie. It has its moments, but it falters in certain aspects due to weak writing, especially concerning the daughter's character. Perhaps she would be better suited to smaller roles until she can enhance her emotional depth and acting skills.",6.0
280180,Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F,"My username hints at my birth year. I was a child of the 1980s and movies like the Beverly Hills Cop franchise were what I grew up on.

Well, that is to say that's what I watched in the 1990s, when my country finally got around to airing Hollywood movies on free TV some 4 to 5 years after their release. It was a great childhood though, with action (+ comedy) movies that featured stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis or Sylvester Stallone. Well, I mentioned the big three, but there are a ton of others worth being added.

With this as my background, ""Axel F"" should be the blast from the past I've been waiting for all decade long. Well, you'd think so, but the early happy feelings don't last more than the moment of recognition. Seeing Eddie Murphy on screen - and reappearing in his defining role no less - was great and he looked surprisingly fit for a 60 plus actor.

But soon enough it became clear, that while the meat was there, it didn't taste right. It's the same disappointment I felt when Bruce Willis did Die Hard 4 over a decade after the third one, only more intense.

Unlike Die Hard though, this movie production was likely based on the premise of bringing the original 80s vibe back. One thing you have to ask yourself though: how could it ever *feel* authentic, when it's actually set in the 2020s? Some things are just painfully cringy, others horribly sad. Like a 60+ old Axel Foley still not having grown up, still wanting to be a street cop and instead of being that lovable screw-up he was in earlier movies, what I saw in movie number four was merely a sad empty shell of a beloved childhood character. You could almost see it in the actor's face, that he's only doing this for the money - for him the $20 million he's rumored to have earned as both producer and actor seem to be worth spitting on the legacy of this franchise. Not that the second but particularly the third movie were as good as the first one, but I still enjoyed them as a teen.",4.0
365177,Borderlands,"Never played the game, enjoyed the film.

I have heard of the video game that <em>'Borderlands'</em> is based upon, though my knowledge of it doesn't extend past that one and only fact. I knew nothing else about it, so I can't comment on this in regards how well it adapts the game. As a movie though, I did get the required enjoyment from it.

Sure the story could've been greater, but what's produced kept me watching all the way through - it's a watchable flick. I did like the cast and characters, all of whom I found suitably interesting. Cate Blanchett is good fun in the lead role, Kevin Hart is perhaps a tad underused but satisfactory nonetheless, while Ariana Greenblatt impresses.

Jack Black is the one I enjoyed most, admittedly that's no surprise given I am a fan of that guy as an actor. I will say that his character is the opposite of Hart's Roland, in that I think the filmmakers should've utilised him less - he does get a bit too much screen time for a side character. However, as it's Black voicing Claptrap I can't possibly say I didn't like seeing him.

How can a movie with such complex and elaborate set, costume design and background can have such a bland, forgettable character with such a boring storyline? I suppose it is not the fault of the movie because it follows the story of a video game? Yet it remains true. I think there's too many characters and not enough time to explore each character. They could have just pick one or two characters for this movie and then add a bit more on the next sequel.",5.0
365177,Borderlands,"Oh come on - it's not that bad! True, there isn't an original thought in it's hundred minute duration and it does look like a very poor relation to a video-game, but it's ""Mad Max"" meets ""Buck Rogers"" vibe just about entertained me. It's all about ""Lilith"" (Cate Blanchett) who is a renowned bounty hunter charged by gazillionaire ""Atlas"" (Edgar Ramirez) with finding his kidnapped daughter ""Tina"" (Ariana Greenblatt). Thing is, she's already been rescued by ""Roland"" (Kevin Hart) and is in no great rush to return to the loving arms of daddy. Whilst trying to track her down, ""Lilith"" encounters the true star of the film - the robot ""Claptrap"", a sarcastic pile of scrap who decides to help out whether she likes it or not, so off they go a-child-hunting. Yep - it proceeds exactly as you'd expect, except for the frankly bamboozling contribution of Jamie Lee Curtis (and her red glasses) who does look like she's enjoying herself on set but, like Blanchett, is just a complete fish out of water as the banal dialogue and set-piece combat scenes pass the entire project into the hands of the CGI developers. This is nothing at all special or memorable, just a predictable action enterprise that takes ""Robot Wars"" to the desert, but if you aim low and take it in the spirit it's clearly intended then it's a perfectly watchable summer adventure.",6.0

365177,Borderlands,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. To preface, I want to clarify that I know nothing about the Borderlands video games—I’ve never played them, and I have no bias against them. However, I approached this movie with some trepidation, knowing Eli Roth's track record with handling other IPs has been less than stellar.

From the outset, Borderlands feels like a blatant attempt to rip off Guardians of the Galaxy. The influence is undeniable, but Roth clearly missed what made Guardians so special. Borderlands is one dance-off scene short of being a direct copy, but even if Roth had included a dance-off, he probably would have cast an Australian Olympic breakdancer—an ill-fitting choice emblematic of how off-target this film is.

The movie throws the audience into a barrage of nonsensical twists and turns that lack coherence or purpose. The narrative seems to be constantly shifting, yet never in a way that feels organic or meaningful. The lack of a coherent plot makes it difficult to stay invested, and the film quickly becomes tedious.

Another glaring issue is the film's failure to create any meaningful connection between its main characters. In Guardians of the Galaxy, the chemistry among the team is a driving force, making their adventures feel both exciting and emotionally resonant. In contrast, Borderlands completely misses this mark. The characters are paper-thin, with little to no development, and their interactions lack the spark needed to make the audience care about their journey.

Visually, the film also disappoints. The aesthetic choices, from the set design to the visual effects, fail to create a compelling or immersive world. The film’s attempt to capture the wild, chaotic energy of the Borderlands universe falls flat, resulting in a bland and uninspired visual experience. 

Overall, Borderlands is a truly boring movie, devoid of character development, narrative coherence, or visual appeal. It’s a film that not only fails to honor the spirit of its source material but also fails to stand on its own as an entertaining piece of cinema. Eli Roth’s attempt to capture the magic of Guardians of the Galaxy is misguided and ultimately unsuccessful, resulting in a forgettable and frustrating experience. This movie serves as a reminder that simply mimicking successful formulas without understanding what makes them work is a recipe for disaster.",1.0

For my money too, much of the cast just don't fit this kind of over the top action genre. As a result a good number of performances feel more than a little awkward.

Any upside? Decent production values, I guess.....

In summary, very little to like here. Bland, brittle exposition with a Borderlands make over, minus all the good things that made the original Borderlands games franchise, so appealing.",3.0

It’s definitely not a movie I’d watch again, but it was entertaining enough that if forced to choose, I’d rather watch it again over any of the Ant-Man films. Michael Douglas and Paul Rudd just don’t do sci-fi well—especially Paul Rudd. I thought Cate Blanchett’s performance wasn’t bad at all, and frankly, some of the reviews here seem like pure trolling.",

It builds stronger character backstories and introduces clearer, though still mysterious, institutional rules. While it can stand alone, watching the first film helps make sense of the ending.

The main conflict revolves around rebellion against Dagin Babi’s leadership, led by the female protagonist and the Barbarians. Though the action is intense and engaging, the resolution is unsatisfying and raises new unanswered questions. The presence of mysterious children on level 333 adds confusion rather than clarity.

Performances, especially from the lead, are strong and supported by solid effects and sound design. Visual details are well-executed, though some plot elements feel inconsistent. While still worth watching, the film adds more mystery than it resolves.

719221,Tarot,"Tarot was a terrible horror movie from start to finish. It’s another low-budget studio horror film that relies heavily on formulaic tropes, stacking one cliché after another in a convoluted story that makes no sense.

The plot is riddled with the usual horror clichés, making it predictable and uninspiring. For instance, the film features the classic haunted object, the mysterious stranger, and the inevitable jump scares. These elements, rather than building suspense or adding depth, only serve to make the narrative feel tired and unoriginal. The lack of creativity in the storyline means that even potential twists are telegraphed far in advance, leaving little room for genuine suspense.

The only bright spot in the film is Jacob Batalon, who adds some much-needed comedy to the otherwise dreary proceedings. His comedic timing provides brief relief from the monotony and gives the audience something to enjoy amidst the chaos but does little to improve the movie.

Even the horror elements, which should be the film’s strength, are poorly executed. The scare scenes are predictable and lack the punch necessary to leave a lasting impact. The build-up to these moments is often clumsy, with telegraphed scares that fail to deliver the desired jolt.

2022’s X was a gritty homage to the brutal horror films of the 1970s, with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre being a major influence. The same year, Pearl offered an even more stylistic approach, serving as a prequel with influences from the silent era and visual nods to The Wizard of Oz. These distinct stylistic choices set a high bar for Maxxxine.

In Maxxxine, we follow the lone survivor of the farmhouse massacres depicted in the first film. Now a bit older and blonder, Mia Goth’s Maxine is still striving to become Hollywood’s next biggest star. She finally lands a role as the lead in a new horror film, but her past begins to catch up with her. She is pursued by a sleazy private investigator, played by Kevin Bacon, who works for a vicious killer targeting Maxine’s closest friends. Concurrently, Maxine must navigate the terror of the Night Stalker, who is haunting Los Angeles, while detectives try to unravel her connection to these events.

Maxxxine is a beautiful love letter to the horror films of the 1980s. Ti West draws influence from many great horror filmmakers of that era. One scene in particular, where Maxine ascends a staircase toward the film’s climax, is reminiscent of the cinematography of David Lynch films from that period. This meticulous attention to style and atmosphere enhances the film’s nostalgic appeal.

Mia Goth is truly fantastic, bringing depth and intensity to her role. Her performance is a highlight of the trilogy, showcasing her versatility as she navigates multiple characters and complex emotional landscapes. For example, her portrayal of Maxine’s relentless determination and underlying vulnerability adds layers to the character, making her journey compelling and relatable.

While Maxxxine is a strong entry in the series, it is, in my opinion, the weakest installment. The film serves as a fitting conclusion to the trilogy but leaves some unresolved threads from X. I would have appreciated more closure regarding the events of the first film, as the connections feel somewhat superficial. Additionally, the reveal of the main antagonist, while surprising, feels somewhat detached from the overarching narrative. For instance, the motivations and background of the killer are not as deeply integrated into the story as they could have been, leading to a somewhat disjointed climax.

Despite these criticisms, Maxxxine is a well-crafted horror film that offers plenty of nods to genre aficionados. Ti West has created a trilogy that honors the horror tradition while bringing fresh and innovative storytelling to the table. The film is rich with familiarities from 1980s horror, making it a nostalgic yet refreshing experience. Mia Goth’s performance ties the trilogy together beautifully, and her portrayal in Maxxxine cements her status as a standout in modern horror cinema. While the film has its flaws, it remains a fitting and enjoyable conclusion to a remarkable series.",8.0
1023922,MaXXXine,"Despite her rather florid past, the eponymous porn star (Mia Goth) is determined to make it in the mainstream and seems well on her way when director ""Elizabeth Bender"" (Elizabeth Debicki) casts her as the lead in the sequel to her own successful first feature. Whilst this is all going on for ""Maxine Minx"", there is a serial killer on the loose in Los Angeles and the police seem to think that maybe she is involved. Obviously she's not the perpetrator of these vicious acts, but might she somehow be the ultimate target? A rather curious meeting with private eye ""Labat"" (Kevin Bacon) suggests that she might want to go a mysterious address where she might learn the truth, but she has her own ideas so with the help of her agent/manager/enforcer ""Teddy"" (Giancarlo Esposito) and a car crusher sets up quite a perilous face-off with a man in black gloves who lives behind a set of green doors. At times this is quite an attitudinal film and Goth does fine, but (no pun intended) Bacon just hams it up too much. Debicki seems totally disinterested in her role and the rest of the cast add very little to a story that is too thinly stretched to pad out one hundred minutes before taking us to a rather weak and rushed denouement. Beware: I sense a sequel might be in the pipe, as if we don't already have enough mediocre slasher fayre on offer already!",6.0

1023922,MaXXXine,"There’s a lot to appreciate about “MaXXXine,” writer/director Ti West‘s latest film in his horror trilogy, even if he doesn’t quite stick the landing. The whole project feels like, as one of his characters says in one of the film’s most memorable lines, a “B-movie with A+ ideas.” There’s plenty of blood and gore to appease slasher fanatics, but there’s a depth to the film that comes from the hefty themes about sex, opportunity, religion, and Hollywood’s dark underbelly.

Set in Los Angeles in the mid-1980s, adult film star and aspiring big studio actress Maxine Minx (Mia Goth) finally gets her big break into the mainstream. She’s been cast in a supporting role in a horror movie sequel and is set to work with up-and-coming director Elizabeth Bender (Elizabeth Debicki). Things are looking up for Maxine career-wise, but a mysterious stalker who is targeting the starlets of Hollywood seems to have her directly in his sights. When a trail of blood makes it clear that several murders are directly connected to her, Maxine starts to worry that her sinister past is going to be exposed.

The first half of the film is also the best, and West fully embraces the decadence and danger that goes along with the backdrop of sleazy Hollywood. Filmed with a vintage aesthetic and Eighties feel, the neon-lit, blood soaked movie looks like it has stepped out of an exploitation cinema time capsule. It’s an homage that’s done exceedingly well, from the cinematography to the soundtrack to the costume design.

The casting is perfect across the board, with standout performances from both Kevin Bacon as a menacing bad guy and Giancarlo Esposito as Maxine’s attorney agent, Teddy Night. (Even the supporting roles are meaty, featuring solid turns from Michelle Monaghan, Moses Sumney, Bobby Cannavale, and Sophie Thatcher). Goth is once again terrific as a shrewd woman with a fierce ambition, lending the ideal mix of street smart toughness with a relatable vulnerability. West never demeans his lead character either, which is refreshing. The film portrays sex work and the adult film industry as a legitimate profession and Maxine as a strong, empowered woman who takes charge of her own destiny.

The second half of the film derails with a conclusion that seems both corny and disappointing (at least on the surface). The ending is left open for rampant speculation, which is probably going to polarize audiences. I think it’s fun when a film can be interpreted in several different ways, but this may prove frustrating for moviegoers who like things very black and white.

Best of all, “MaXXXine” leaves plenty of room for a fourth film featuring the character, which I certainly hope we get.

1023922,MaXXXine,"MAXXXINE holds many strong ideas & thematic weight, but fails to bring it all together in a cohesive, captivating fashion. Everything feels less than its predecessors, where the only outstanding constant is Mia Goth's terrific central performance. Underwhelming.

Rating: C",5.0
1023922,MaXXXine,"Maxxine is the third installment in a confusing trilogy of movies. After enduring the first film, X, which was essentially a low-quality adult film, and only partially watching the second film, Pearl, which was equally disappointing, I had low expectations for Maxxine.

Assuming it would follow the same pattern, I made sure no children were present before watching it alone. Surprisingly, Maxxine had less nudity, only appearing twice, compared to its predecessors. Instead, it focused more on horror and thriller elements, following an aspiring actress being stalked by a serial killer named Knight and another mysterious figure out to harm her.

While this film didn't win me over completely, I appreciated that it actually had a plot and some semblance of a storyline, unlike the previous entries in the trilogy. For those who enjoy quirky, over-the-top thrillers with unconventional writing, Maxxine may be worth a watch. However, if you prefer gripping, edge-of-your-seat thrillers, this may not be the film for you.

After viewing Maxxine, I concluded that it was not something I would revisit or add to my collection. It's the kind of movie you watch once and then move on from, ticking it off your list without a second thought.",5.0
1023922,MaXXXine,"**Maxxxine** serves as a **crowd-pleasing** end to a strong trilogy. No fuss, no frills, decent pacing, with a more simplified **action-focused** plot. Lots of **good gore**, and perfect to kiss in the back of a cinema to. **8/10**",8.0
1023922,MaXXXine,"<em>'MaXXXine'</em> is a positive end (?) to this trilogy of Ti West-directed flicks. I'd rank it below the prior releases, but that's simply because I enjoyed those ones more. This one is absolutely a good movie, yet again Mia Goth and the visuals are my biggest elements to praise.

Away from the splendid Goth, Kevin Bacon is the one I liked most from the rest; he plays a successfully sleazy dude. Away from them, I wanted to see more of Giancarlo Esposito, while Michelle Monaghan and Bobby Cannavale are solid; Elizabeth Debicki too (still can't unhear Diana, mind).

The conclusion underwhelmed me, I won't lie. The reveal and just the way the plot goes in general just didn't really click with me. I wouldn't at all say it's explicitly a bad ending, it just didn't give me proper satisfaction. All in all, I did have a good time watching this and the series overall.

""Wolfs is one of the most recommendable films of the year. Though it doesn’t reinvent the wheel in the action-comedy genre, it stands out for the undeniable chemistry between George Clooney and Brad Pitt, who elevate a generic yet incredibly entertaining script.

Jon Watts keeps the pacing agile and fun, capitalizing on the never-ending banter between the protagonists to offer moments of sarcastic, ironic enjoyment. Austin Abrams also deserves recognition as a pleasant surprise, perfectly balancing naivety and comedy.

Ultimately, it’s a light, accessible movie for all audiences.""

877817,Wolfs,"""Wolfs"" is a rather downbeat crime thriller, that doesn't quite make the most of its potential. 

Perhaps, my biggest gripe with this film is it tends to dismiss its actually quite interesting, peripheral characters, in favour of its big stars, in this case George Clooney and Brad Pitt. 

My wife who sat and watched this with me, said in essence it was a dissatisfying experience and I'm inclined to agree. Yes, there are instances in cinema where someone ""steals the show"" with a stand out performance but more typically, its the whole cast who make a film shine. The failure to extend the role of interesting secondary characters is a shame and I, for one, felt this film would have been better, had that been the case. The end results a film that's still quite watchable but also feels somehow abrupt and incomplete. 

In summary, ""Wolfs"" doesn't quite make the most of its potential by making decisions that actually limit the films scope and depth. The results mildly entertaining but by no means remarkable.",6.0
560016,Monkey Man,"Slightly too long, but pretty much every other element of <em>'Monkey Man'</em> is more than enough to compensate.

I had a very good time watching what is Dev Patel's directorial debut. He himself is outstanding, having portrayed the role of the titular character perfectly. I had only seen the guy in two films (<em>'Slumdog Millionaire'</em> & <em>'The Last Airbender'</em>) prior to this, so very much happy to see him act further. An excellent job from him on and off screen, I'm happy that he managed to get this made in the end.

As noted, I do think the run time could've been trimmed a little. It's not a major issue of mine, at all, but at a few moments I did feel my interest wane a bit. The story itself is a good one though, one that is entwined with a lot of fight (literally) but a lot of feeling too. Visually, it's a beauty. As for those behind Patel, Pitobash and Vipin Sharma are positives; Ashwini Kalsekar does well too.

""Monkey Man shows that Dev Patel still has much to learn when it comes to directing and writing, but his unwavering commitment to a culturally and thematically rich story deserves countless praises.

A revenge arc with some pacing issues narrative-wise, but with action sequences loaded with energy and adrenaline, even when chaotically choreographed and shot. Predictably dedicated performance from Patel that avoids some genre formulas while paying homage to some of the classics that inspired him.

An imperfect yet compelling debut.""

Rating: B",7.0
560016,Monkey Man,"Dev Patel has spoken a lot about him not wanting to be ""James Bond"" but it looks like those stories have inspired quite a bit of this pretty derivative revenge thriller that actually reminded me a bit of his ""Hotel Mumbai"" (2018) outing too. We know that he (""Kid"") routinely dons a monkey mask for some wrestling and he duly gets a pasting - but that this all has purpose. That purpose starts to come together when he manages to organise a subtle sting operation on ""Queenie"" (Ashwini Kalsekar) who runs an high-end gentleman's club. His reward here is a job. In the kitchens, bleaching the toilets and washing the pots. A means to an end though as he befriends the drug-pusher ""Alphonso"" (Pitobash) - who has a nifty, turbo-charged, tuk-tuk, and is soon elevated to the rank of waiter to the corrupt and profligate of city society who frequent the place. Interspersed with his burgeoning career, we begin to see flashbacks of his childhood - and of the brutality that reduced him to his present, vengeful, circumstances. The story is set against a backdrop of political turmoil and with an election looming, he becomes aware that there are wheels within wheels and that his principle antagonist is firmly amongst the secular and religious plotters. He also finds himself being cared for by a sagely monk ""Alpha"" (Vipin Sharma) who helps him to focus both his mind and his body as we build to a denouement that can be seen from space by anyone who's ever seen a ""John Wick"" film. Patel is a charismatic man but that's not what's needed here. That's something just a little more original to keep this over-long two hours from becoming just a bit dull and procedural. It's not terrible, but it's not really up to much either.",6.0
560016,Monkey Man,"This movie is a boring John Wick wannabe (they literally mention John Wick in the movie). The action sucks, the cinematography is nauseating, the story is boring. There's nothing good about this movie. I'm convinced the high reviews are probably from Indians, as they like to rate shit movies highly. If you're not Indian, don't waste your time on this crap.",3.0
560016,Monkey Man,"There's a recurrent metaphor throughout the film, of Hanuman trying to eat the sun leaping towards it Icarus-like and being stopped by the gods eventually. Maybe Dev Patel was aware of how well this metaphor would encapsulate his brave directorial debut too, all throughout the film he's trying to reach the narrative he wants to tell but he eventually pulls his own punches. Only if he knew his film would eventually not release in Indian theaters at all, howmuchever he restrains himself.

Don't get me wrong, this is a highly enjoyable film. But the commentary on the current Indian society and what is plaguing it and all the classist and casteist divides we have setup within ourselves -- all of that comes out a tad bit feeble and a bit too watered-down.

You can see Dev touching majorly on religious blind-faith intermingling with politics, but also offhandedly on caste and patriarchy too -- there's even a montage of real-life videos of a few of these evils thrown in for good measure -- but everything is a bit too sanitised and it doesn't jolt you. Not for a single moment did the film drown me in itself with these thoughts, always swimming on the surface. Water and fire are another recurrent tropes which occur throughout, another piece of foresight by Dev on how his fire would eventually be watered and we would just swim on the surface of it.

Having said that all out, I completely dig the film for its action and how it tries to mix Indian music and instruments throughout. **There's Zakir Hussain in it ffs, now THAT is what true cameos should be like, completely unexpected and swooping you in.** I've always liked Dev's performance and here he proves he's as good behind the camera as he is on it. It was great to see familiar Indian faces as well. There's also one homage to _Ghajini_ in there which I feel was a great nod.

One last piece of critique and then I would leave: the fictional cities and villages all feel lived-in and real, but at the same time a little bit Westernised too to be uniquely identified as Indian.",7.0
560016,Monkey Man,"When I saw the trailer for Monkey Man, I was unsure of what to expect. It seemed like a standard revenge tale with a horror twist. However, what I got was one of my favorite films of the year. Dev Patel shines not only in his acting but also in his directing. This film is much more than another John Wick type of movie; it delves into deep themes and presents a complex narrative that I thoroughly enjoyed.

Initially, the trailer gave the impression of a conventional revenge story with some horror elements. However, the film exceeds these expectations by offering a richer, more nuanced narrative. The themes explored are profound, touching on revenge, justice, and the human condition. 

Dev Patel's dual role as actor and director is impressive. His performance is both intense and layered, bringing depth to his character's journey. Additionally, his direction is sharp, balancing action with moments of introspection.

The film is more than just an action-packed revenge story; it explores deeper themes that resonate on multiple levels. The narrative examines the nature of revenge and its impact on the individual and society. For example, the protagonist's quest isn't just about personal vendetta but also about addressing the broader corruption and injustice in the city. This thematic depth sets the film apart from more straightforward action movies.

My biggest gripe is that the story could benefit from a longer runtime (which I NEVER say). The film occasionally feels rushed, particularly in the latter half when the protagonist begins his hunt. More time to build tension and develop interactions would enhance the overall impact. 

Despite this minor flaw, the movie is fantastic. It stands out for its strong performances, thoughtful direction, and complex narrative. Dev Patel has proven himself as a talented filmmaker capable of delivering both action and substance. I look forward to seeing more from him in the future and hope he continues to explore and expand on these rich themes.",8.0
560016,Monkey Man,"Fans of elevated revenge action films are going to be flat-out dazzled by “Monkey Man,” the directorial debut of Dev Patel (who also co-wrote and stars as the titular character). Many actors are unsuccessful when attempting to make the transition from in front of the camera to behind it, but Patel has the talent to back it up tenfold. This story of vengeance is done so well that I have very few criticisms. It exceeds expectations in all respects.

The anonymous Kid (Patel) makes a living by sparring for cash in a seedy underground fight club. His gimmick includes wearing a gorilla mask and agreeing to take the fall to his more popular opponents. After enduring bloody beatings for years while carrying with him a terrible childhood trauma, Kid’s rage has grown to astronomical levels. When he discovers a way to infiltrate the city’s elaborate network of corrupt leaders who are responsible for his mother’s death, Kid makes it his personal mission to exact revenge. In the process, he becomes a savior of the people, an underdog who helps the powerless settle the score and right the wrongs that they’ve all endured at the hands of the elite.

It’s a simple story that works well for a revenge film, as Kid has a great motivation for unleashing his violent retribution. This makes him a hero you want to root for. He’s a murderer, but the people he kills most certainly had it coming. Patel (along with co-writers Paul Angunawela and John Collee) include culturally-appropriate thematic elements that make a statement on the current political climate in India, which lends a depth to the story that makes it as meaningful as it is entertaining.

Heavily influenced by “The Raid,” “John Wick,” and Korean cinema, eagle-eyed viewers will catch many references and homages to these films. Thankfully, Patel’s approach doesn’t feel like a sad imitation of similar revenge action movies. The production values are fantastic, and every element falls into place. Patel has a great visual style that feels like he’s approaching his direction as a fan who understands the language of cinema (particularly action). There is some really creative stuff here, from the inventive kills to the exciting stunts.

The fight choreography is nothing short of excellent, and the realistic makeup and stunt coordination combine to make the hand-to-hand brawls feel so authentic The sets and creative duels are absolutely terrific, and fans of the genre will not be disappointed.

The film has its share of violent, bloody mayhem, but it’s not as action-packed as you may be led to believe. There is a lot of story, but it’s a strong one. The fighting doesn’t start until a good 40 minutes into the film, so it’s a good thing that the dramatic elements work so well (the narrative lags briefly about halfway through, however).

The biggest surprise to come out of the film is that Patel actually has the talent to back up everything he attempts, from the stunt work (which resulted in multiple personal injuries), writing, direction, and acting. Lanky and thin, he’s an atypical action star, but he sells it here as a scrappy yet powerful fighter who is dismissed as “a kid from the gutter.” You will cheer when Kid embarks on his savage rampage of revenge, especially when this nobody eventually becomes a somebody. Turns out, Patel is a badass action star with an undeniable charm, which makes for a magic combination.

“Monkey Man” strikes the right balance between meaningful political commentary and full-speed fun, and Patel does both equally well. Topped off with its stylish, gritty atmosphere and high-energy action, this is the type of film that will get you energized about the genre.

560016,Monkey Man,"Cool but somewhat sloppy, like the first half of this story doesn't need to happen. I'd have liked to see more of Monkey's journey to the city, or his establishment as kind slum overlord. More adventure than scenes of him getting beat up. How'd he build up to such an elaborate purse snatching? Seems more lucrative than his night job. Rigged, zero-stakes fights of our guy wearing a mask. I suppose it couldn't have been called Monkey Man without.

Engaging look into a side of India that seems to be ignored by many films. I liked the grit. Kept me engaged. Good scenes, unbelievable story elements. Our lead doesn't seem overly religious, his mission isn't one of a god fearing man...yet the focus of all the mother scenes is preaching the one true god.

560016,Monkey Man,"Monkey Man might be thematically Incoherent, but it's action is just so insane and grimey that you can't help but enjoy the killer debut.

There is clear potential in Dev Patel's direction, he utilizes dynamic and powerful camera work without sacrificing too much clarity, and instills beauty and warmth besides all the rage, violence, and savage brutality of his fights. I also like how clear the character development is shown throughout this movie, by using both cinematography and choreography to showcase his growth from sloppy, anxious, and erratic kid to fast, slick, and stylish fighter.

You can really feel all of his sloppiness and mistakes in the first half of the movie with how sloppy and shaky the camera work is. It also has a lot of fast cuts between multiple people, and had constant use of blurry and bokeh shots.

But once the protagonist trains and heals in the 2nd half, (in a very sick montage btw) we now see much longer takes, much more stable and clear camera work, and has evolved himself into a more methodical, faster, and untouchable no-bullshit fighter who can destroy his opponents with one kick.

All of this is just so fucking fun to see, especially for a first time director. And despite a lot of it still needing more refinement, these flaws honestly just makes me more excited for his future projects. Because if this is Patel at his base form, just imagine what happens when he truly unlocks and polishes all of his techniques.

661539,A Complete Unknown,"I grew up in an household that loved Bob Dylan and Joan Baez (though not equally from parent to parent!), and I think it really only instilled in me a sense of contrariness. The more my dad banged on about how great Dylan and his lyrics were, the more that fell of deaf childish ears. Sitting down now I was worried I'd revert to my self of fifty-odd years ago, but thanks to a pretty convincing effort from Timothée Chalamet I actually found my feet moving - and not towards the door! It doesn't do him any harm that he resembles the man, and he manages to convey something of the spirit of this poet who, upon hearing that Woody Guthrie (Scoot McNairy) is on his last legs in hospital, travels to New York to track him down. He finds Pete Seeger (Edward Norton) at the bedside of a sick man, plays him a song he's written about his hero and now thanks to some patronage from Seeger he starts to get gigs, meets ""Sylvie"" (Elle Fanning) then the already successful Baez (Monica Barbara) before taking the world - and Johnny Cash (Boyd Holbrook) by storm. It's a classy biopic that, though chronological, isn't just a straight history of the man. It shows his character, warts and all, as he comes to terms with his success and some of the temptations and fickleness that goes along with it. Many critics say Dylan is the worst singer of his own songs and Chalamet keeps up that tradition offering some authentic sounding, but different enough, interpretations of some of the man's most recognisable songs. Barbaro also turns in well as Baez, though I found her voice just a little too operatic and not quite as effective. The production is clearly high-end with loads of attention to the detail, but essentially this is really a chance for Chalamet to show he is more than just a (very) skinny boy with floppy hair. Purists of the artiste may hate it, but I think it quite powerfully characterises this group of free thinking individuals in a 1960s America dealing with a presidential assassination, communist threats and a general sense of paranoia amongst a public that was clearly crying out for something to hope for. Dylan et al delivered some of that, and this comes across well.",7.0
661539,A Complete Unknown,"Tribute biographies have become an increasingly popular film genre in recent years, though, truthfully, they’re not all of the same caliber. Content and authenticity play significant roles in their overall quality, but, as experience has shown, these traits can vary widely, depending on the picture. As for writer-director James Mangold’s homage to musician-folk singer-songwriter Bob Dylan (Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet), the film presents viewers with a mixed bag on these fronts. While this effort seems to mostly get things right in matters of authenticity, it comes up somewhat short on content, despite its protracted 2:21:00 runtime, what should amount to sufficient duration to nail down the most crucial cinematic particulars. “A Complete Unknown” follows Dylan from his arrival in New York in 1961, where he quickly became the latest sensation on the Greenwich Village folk music scene, through his rise to stardom as an emerging music industry icon and culminating in his controversial performance at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, where he traded in his acoustic guitar for an electric model, a switch met with mixed reactions but that launched him in innovative new directions musically. Along the way, viewers are let in on passing scenes from his personal life, such as his friendships with fellow musicians Pete Seeger (Oscar nominee Edward Norton), Johnny Cash (Boyd Holbrook) and Woody Guthrie (Scoot McNairy), as well as his passionate but stormy romances with Sylvie Russo (a pseudonym for real life love interest Suze Rotolo) (National Board of Review Award winner Elle Fanning) and fellow folk singer Joan Baez (Oscar nominee Monica Barbaro). But, regrettably, much of the narrative is little more than a loosely strung together collection of sequences designed to showcase an array of Dylan’s greatest hits from the early days of his career, as well as those of his peers. While the songs are indeed capably performed by the actors themselves, after a while though, the film feels more like an anthology of music videos than an insightful biography. In fact, Dylan’s character comes across as largely enigmatic and inscrutable, a take on his persona alleged to be true to form but that doesn’t offer a great deal of enlightenment into his nature – that is, other than often making him look like a first-class jerk (the noble content of his social activism compositions notwithstanding). Consequently, this candid but somewhat unflattering approach almost makes one wonder whether a protagonist like Dylan is innately worthy of such an homage, even if the finished product is on point (and ironically lends credence to the meaning of the film’s title, whether intentional or not). All things considered, on balance, the filmmaker’s effort here is passable as a capably made tribute bio, with generally fine performances (especially Fanning, who genuinely should have earned supporting actress award kudos over her somewhat overrated co-star), commendable period piece production values and a fine soundtrack (if one is an ardent Dylan fan, that is, something I honestly can’t claim to be). But is this release really worthy of all the awards season attention it has garnered? That seems like something of a stretch to me, but, given the lackluster nature of the crop of 2024 awards season candidates, the pickings have admittedly been somewhat slim. Devotees of the protagonist are virtually certain to come away from this offering suitably impressed, though the rest of us are more likely to heave a modest shoulder shrug and move on to the next movie.",6.0
661539,A Complete Unknown,"<em>'A Complete Unknown'</em> is a biopic worth watching. I only know of Bob Dylan by name and possibly some vague recognition of a few of his songs, as is usual for me it seems; uncultured swine. Therefore, I was only coming into this to see how it came out as a film - it's very good!

Timothée Chalamet's portrayal is impressive for the large majority, I will say his schtick comes across as a little forced in one or two parts (only one or two) and I also had difficulty totally understanding him in a few moments (only a few). Edward Norton is good too, I thought he'd feature more; if only because I saw him on the promo trail with Chalamet a lot.

Elle Fanning and Monica Barbaro offer noteworthy performances, everyone on the cast is perfectly fine to be fair. The music seems well done to me, again I'm not someone who definitively knows Dylan's work but it felt well shown. It's possibly too prevalent, which is a weird thing to say about a musician biopic but there's a lot of music in this.

The end at the festival is the scene that I'll remember most from this, the sound design is particularly excellent; was practically bouncing in my seat due to the noise.

661539,A Complete Unknown,"Bob Dylan fans should know that director James Mangold’s “A Complete Unknown” isn’t trying to do an in-depth study of the folk music legend, but it’s a solid ride for anyone who loves his music or is curious about his early days. The film gives us a peek into the ‘60s when Dylan was just starting to make waves, showing him as this enigmatic, difficult, and very self-absorbed figure who was about to change the music world for the better.

A real treat for fans of Dylan’s music, the film captures the essence of the man without trying to over-analyze him. The story gives a cool glimpse of who he was during the pivotal time in his career when he went from a fresh-faced, unknown folk singer to a game-changing, controversial figure.

Timothée Chalamet does a fantastic job portraying Dylan, both in terms of his look and his attitude. He channels the aloof, enigmatic, and often prickly demeanor that Dylan has always been (and remains) famous for. In reality, it’s a well-known fact that Dylan’s always been a bit of a jerk, and Chalamet nails that part of his personality. It’s not so much about exploring Dylan’s selfish psyche as it is about watching him move through this phase of his life, seemingly unaware or uninterested in the way he’s affecting those around him. His relationship with the iconic musicians in his orbit, like Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro, in a wonderfully understated performance) and Johnny Cash (Boyd Holbrook, who completely chews up the screen that is oh-so-Cashlike), feels a little cold and distant, which makes sense for the character.

The film centers around the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, the infamous event where Dylan electrified his sound and alienated some of his folk music fans in the process. This moment, which was a major turning point in his career, is depicted in a way that focuses on the tension and not just the performance itself. Dylan’s self-centeredness and drive to push boundaries are clear, but the film doesn’t really dig too deep into the reasons behind his decisions. In other words, Dylan’s just kind of doing his thing, as artists often do.

The supporting cast is solid as well, with Ed Norton as Pete Seeger adding some nice weight to the narrative, and Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo playing a key role in Dylan’s personal life.

The standout, of course, is the music. The renditions of Dylan’s classic songs are excellent (with Chalamet performing the tunes himself), and the film captures the electric energy of the era’s folk scene.

“A Complete Unknown” doesn’t offer much new insight into Dylan as a person, but if you’re a fan of his music and the era, it’s a blast to spend time with him. This is not a groundbreaking biopic, but a fun, nostalgic journey through a key moment in music history.

661539,A Complete Unknown,"I wanted to see it in the theater, but on the way there I realized that I don't smoke enough pot to like more than a couple of his songs and one of them I liked better when Jimi did it anyway, so my wife and I went on a bike ride instead and I waited until it hit Hulu.

The thing about it is, despite not liking his music, I do like the music from his era a hell of a lot, and the trivia, and even the conspiracies around them that I only sometimes believe... no, it's 2025, I don't know what to believe... but I know enough about Bob to be dangerous and that sort of means I know enough about him to be irritated on it's total lack of accuracy.

I'm pretty sure AI wrote the bulk of the script.  It's not that he wasn't iconic, I get that he was, I even understand why people like him, and Rod Stewart, I even like the occasional singer that is constantly off key, that wasn't the problem.  The problem was that it wasn't a movie about Bob.  It felt more like AI looking at Ray, Bohemian Rhapsody, Walk the Line, La Bamba, Great Balls of Fire, the biopics of famous musicians, combined it with Almost Famous, and then generated a generic script based on what AI thought his life story should be based of the success of other music biopics.  

It's so filtered, it's practically Bob Dylan with autotune.  Not sure how people could like it.",1.0
437342,The First Omen,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/the-first-omen-review-a-must-watch/

""The First Omen holds many narrative issues and a too-safe ending, but it deserves to be seen on the big screen due to its grotesque practical effects, hauntingly well-built atmosphere, and one of the most impressive, transformative performances of the year by Nell Tiger Free.

Debutant filmmaker Arkasha Stevenson clearly leaves her mark on a technically sublime film that easily becomes the best installment of the franchise after the original movie.

Lead yourself into temptation and embrace the incarnated evil. You won't regret it.""

Rating: B-",6.0
437342,The First Omen,"Novice ""Margaret"" (Nell Tiger Free) arrives in Rome to a welcome from her cardinal sponsor ""Lawrence"" (Bill Nighy) where she hopes to complete taking her vows. She is greeted with open arms and taken on a tour of what she hopes will become her new home. This is when she encounters the shy ""Carlita"" (Nicole Sorace) who spends much of her time in solitude drawing. This intrigues ""Margaret"" but not as much as some of the other goings on in the maternity ward of the hospital. Her concerns are only exacerbated by a meeting with ""Fr. Brennan"" (Ralph Ineson) who spins her an horrific yarn that makes her head spin and sets her on a detection task that reveals a conspiracy to end all conspiracies - one that is conceived by the church for it's own perpetuation, but that could bring down both it and mankind. At times it's quite a decently paced watch, this, with a little gruesomeness (isn't it odd that the tools of medicine so often look like those of torture?) but given we have known the denouement since 1976 the lack of any real jeopardy does rather rob the film of much of a sense of menace and what ""jump moments"" there are are all a bit predictable. Free does try to imbue her character with a bit of passion, and she manages along well enough but Nighy is weak and the single appearance from Charles Dance adds nothing at all to these lacklustre proceedings. Prequels are always hard to deliver. This tries, but sadly we've seen it all before and I fear the nun theme is beginning to self-flagellate itself to death. A short story over-stretched.",6.0
437342,The First Omen,"The First Omen, like so many latter day spin offs, of well respected franchises, fails to understand what made the original films so successful. 

I well remember the original Omen film and how it held me. Its intricate story, which chillingly displaced a sense of normalcy with a ever growing  horror and otherworldly menace, was truly compelling. 

By contrast. The First Omen lacks true progression and originality. For well over half the film, it is, in fact, rather dull. It does make vain attempts to utilises tropes and events of the earlier films but fails to develop a measurably meaningful, original narrative, to accompany them. Moreover, as other reviewers have stated, quite correctly, in my view, its safe ending does little to mitigate the overriding sense of cinematic malaise.

In summary, if you have never experienced the Omen franchise, don't start with this film. The original films are horror masterpieces, well worth your time. By contrast, this film will, I suspect, be remembered as a minor footnote with Omen fans, like myself and that's if its lucky.",6.0
437342,The First Omen,"The First Omen"" is a chilling and atmospheric horror film that effectively pays homage to the original which came out in 1976 while presenting a fresh and unsettling perspective, with standout performances and direction that will leave viewers on edge. The film's atmospheric tension, creepy moments, and effective storytelling makes is a worthwhile horror flick. Director Arkasha Stevenson's debut film impresses with its confident direction and storytelling, featuring a standout performance by Nell Tiger Free. She literally has given a performance to remember.The film's slow pace can irritate a few viewers, as well as the unexpected ending tying it to the original of 1976 can be questionable, but overall, the film shines in its ability to evoke a haunting atmosphere and deliver scares without relying on cheap jump scares or gimmicks. A worthy prequel.",
437342,The First Omen,"This was shot and directed well and the way that Margaret's story was constructed early on was interesting.  The movie is less appealing in its final act as it ushers in the arrival of the antichrist and tries to tie itself into the original **Omen** film.  That film was made almost 50 years ago, and most modern moviegoers aren't going to appreciate the effort.

There aren't many jump scares in this, a couple of them occur early, but this doesn't really have any sustained scares, either.  There are strange moments but nothing that will keep anyone from good night's sleep.",6.0

437342,The First Omen,"This movie was ultimately pointless. While it featured some cool visuals and interesting death scenes, it was overall very boring and failed to add anything significant to the lore of the franchise.

The film does have moments of visual flair, with certain scenes showcasing impressive special effects and creative cinematography. A major issue with the film is the way it handles its female characters. The writing falls into condescending tropes that undermine the potential for strong storytelling. Female characters are often depicted in stereotypical roles, diminishing their complexity and impact on the plot. 

Additionally, the film attempts to delve into the Christian-based horror sub-genre, specifically exorcism themes, but falls short of creating genuine scares. Studios often struggle with making these films truly terrifying because they lack a deep understanding of the faith’s principles. The result is a portrayal that feels hollow and inauthentic.

One solution could be to hire screenwriters who are well-versed in Christian theology and culture to bring authenticity to the sub-genre. Marketing these films to a Christian audience might also prove interesting and create a more engaged viewer base. Authenticity in storytelling could transform the genre, making it more impactful and frightening. 

As someone who does not identify as Christian, I can see the potential for more meaningful and scary films within this sub-genre if approached with respect and depth. The current approach, however, leaves much to be desired and feels disconnected from the true essence of the faith it seeks to portray.

Overall, while the movie offers some interesting visuals and death scenes, it ultimately fails to deliver a compelling or original story. The condescending portrayal of women and the hollow execution of Christian-based horror elements significantly detract from its potential. Studios need to rethink their approach to both character writing and genre-specific storytelling to create more engaging and authentic films.",2.0
437342,The First Omen,"Why does the modern horror community settle for such mediocrity in film making? Don't be so lazy and settle for the usual unfulfilling, stereo typical Hollywood dreck such as this. There are so many fantastic indie horror movies being made out there.",1.0
437342,The First Omen,"I really don't see the point of making a prequel that retcons the original films.  Hollywood does it all the time, and when you hear the creators it is always to own the fans in some way.  As in: ""this will anger the fans of the original"" 

I don't understand how they think it's a good idea given that the fans are the reason the movies are worth making sequels, prequels, and reboots of.

So they seem to intentionally NOT want the fans to see it, and then are always angered when the movies fail.

But sometimes it's because Hollywood hires people who proudly didn't see the source material and then don't require them to watch the source material.

In either case they always seem shocked when the movie fails.

I read the plot and... didn't see it until fate made me, and the reason I didn't see it is because they outright said what they retconed.  

I'm not sure if it failed or not, but watching through it I couldn't help but think ""Why rewrite the Omen?  Why does my wife want to watch this?"" and then when it was over ""Well, yeah, I can understand why you don't like it honey, you're right, they changed too much.""",1.0
437342,The First Omen,"""The First Omen"" approaches the whole franchise in much the same way as George Lucas did with his ""Star Wars"" prequels (1999-2005). Lucas took some ideas which had only been hinted at in the dialogue and then he simply expanded upon them. The ""Omen"" film which emerges here using this same method has been superbly directed by Arkasha Stevenson and it does manage to create a particularly threatening atmosphere which is allowed to subtly develop from the very beginning and then it gradually comes to the forefront and eventually permeates everything by the end. The idea of a sinister conclave existing within the church  and working its own agenda is a magnificent concept and it has been marvellously used here with deeply disturbing results. However, it is somewhat unfortunate this film also resembles ""To The Devil A Daughter"" (1976) at least in the beginning. This realisation hits home almost as soon as Margaret makes her first appearance on screen and the moment of revelation which comes much later on has no real impact at all because of it.",7.0
1013850,A Real Pain,"Finding ourselves, particularly the process of finding what we’ve lost about ourselves, can be an eye-opening, enlightening but sometimes-painful ordeal, especially if we’re unclear about where to look. For many of us, though, this is a challenge we often attempt to resolve by examining our past, specifically that of our family and its legacy, in hopes that it provides the answers we seek. Such is the quest embarked upon by two once-close cousins, David (Jesse Eisenberg) and Benji (Kieran Culkin), who journey to Poland on an intimate heritage tour to visit the homestead of their beloved deceased grandmother, a Holocaust survivor who made her way to America after World War II. While David and Benji were at one time as thick as thieves, they’ve drifted apart over time, each becoming significantly different from one another, but they hope to reestablish their longstanding connection through this intensely personal pilgrimage. As their odyssey unfolds, though, they come face to face with the changes that have arisen both in their relationship and in their understandings of themselves, from life goals to their cultural background as the descendants of Polish Jews to how they fundamentally relate to the world. It’s an often-difficult process for these earnest seekers, especially in light of their discovery that, if they truly wish to better understand themselves, they can only go so far in looking outward, instead needing to look inward for guidance and meaningful insight. And its aptly selected title is an ably suitable metaphor on multiple levels, not only in describing Benji’s often-manic, irrational and unpredictable behavior, but also in characterizing the anguish that he and David undergo in making their way through this emotional minefield. This second feature effort from actor-writer-director Eisenberg is indeed an impressive offering, even if its road trip/buddy movie script could use some periodic tweaking in terms of focus and its balance between comedy and drama. More significantly, however, this is a breakout performance for Culkin, who shows just how adept he can be with the right material, an award-worthy portrayal, to be sure. Add to this the film’s gorgeous cinematography of Polish landmarks and the country’s landscapes, as well as its fittingly appropriate Frédéric Chopin soundtrack, and you’ve got a profoundly thoughtful release, one that should give anyone in the cousins’ shoes pause for reflection, something from which we can all benefit from time to time, no matter what we’re ultimately looking for.",7.0
1013850,A Real Pain,"Written and directed by Jesse Eisenberg, A Real Pain sees two cousins reunite after a long period. David (Eisenberg) and Benji (Kieran Culkin) were raised together and were around each other so much growing up that they were brothers. They meet up in the present day for a Poland Holocaust tour that culminates with them visiting the house that once belonged to their grandmother.  

David and Benji are at two different stages of life despite being a few months apart. David has a full-time job, a wife, and a kid while Benji is single and doesn’t have a job. While David has fond memories of their grandmother, she was Benji’s favorite person in the world and her death took a huge toll on him that he still hasn’t gotten over.

The two estranged cousins are complete opposites of one another. David plays it safe and is typically very quiet while adhering to the rules that are laid out before him. Benji is outspoken, charming, and doesn’t care what people think. People always know how he feels, which isn’t always a good thing since his moods change on a whim.

The performances are interesting because Jesse Eisenberg has always had this kind of neurotic demeanor about him as an actor (talks fast with few pauses, is anxious around other people, totally awkward). Leave it to a film that he writes, directs, and stars in for him to play the more grounded of the two main characters.

When Benji’s unusual behavior becomes unbearable, David cracks under the pressure of trying to hold it together and be the more level-headed of the two. Eisenberg portrays frustration, anger, sadness, and love in a way that is relatable and believable.

Kieran Culkin steals nearly every scene he’s in as Benji. As a character, Benji has a way of being the center of attention without really trying. He speaks his mind and does what he wants. He doesn’t care if he comes as rude or down to earth or like an asshole. He is effortlessly charismatic and funny with a ton of potential to be more than he is. But he’s also broken and the entire tour group can see that. Like Benji wears on David, he can be overbearing at times to the audience but that also makes the character feel that much more genuine.

There’s a fine line between paying respect and being blasphemous in A Real Pain. David doesn’t want to be disrespectful in any way while Benji makes his decision based on how he feels. For example, posing dramatically and humorously in front of a monument honoring those who gave their lives during the war could be seen as therapeutic or shameful. Later in the film, the tour group doesn’t see an issue traveling in a first-class train car while Benji is immensely offended since Jews were forced to ride in the very back of the train.

The film is written in a way that reveals a bit more behind each cousin as the film progresses. What begins as two cousins traveling to Poland and paying respect to their grandmother evolves into David worrying whether or not Benji can survive on his own while Benji is upset that he doesn’t hear from David much anymore because he’s a family man with a career. They’re two different sides of the same coin: one cousin is taking life too seriously while the other doesn’t take it seriously enough.

And as a neutral party watching this all unfold, you can see the benefits and shortcomings of both sides. Being married, having a child, and having a full-time job takes up all your free time. On the other hand, not having a job leaves you with more time to feel like no one has time for you anymore. Both cousins are at an impasse and maybe that’s the takeaway from A Real Pain: to make do and appreciate what you’ve got.

And the film ends in a way that doesn’t resolve anything. As adults, we age, get invested in our careers, and drift away from friends and family who were once close because of our commitments as responsible people. A Real Pain touches on that concept.

The more we want things to change and the more we want our loved ones to be safe and happy there’s only so much we can do before we go back to our regularly scheduled and separate lives. We just have to hope that that bond and nostalgia that we share is enough until we’re able to meet again. Just because you reach out doesn’t mean things will get better. It lets that loved one know you care and sometimes that’s enough.

A Real Pain capitalizes on the ups and downs of traveling with a family member. You love them and have a deep connection with them, but they also annoy you to no end and are reminded why you don’t see them more often.

Jesse Eisenberg has made a film that is emotionally powerful and unbelievably relatable while Kieran Culkin delivers an exhaustingly mesmerizing performance loaded with depth and relentless magnetism. The way the film revolves around such flawed individuals makes them feel grounded in reality and A Real Pain feels like bona fide cinema because of it.",7.0

1013850,A Real Pain,"""Grandma Dory"" has passed away and left her two grandsons some money so that they can take a trip to Poland and see where she grew up amidst the Nazi invasion and subsequent holocaust. These two are cousins. ""David"" (Jesse Eisenberg) is a bit of a shy, geeky, type who lives in New York with his wife and child. ""Banji"" (Kieran Culkin) is quite the opposite. A free spirited, thinking and speaking individual who cares little for what anyone else thinks about him. The pair clearly love each other, but the behaviour of the latter continues to rattle his travelling companion, especially when they meet up with the other members of their touring party in Warsaw. What now ensues is quite a testament to both Eisenberg's vision as a writer/director but also to the inspired casting of Culkin. He is the kind of holiday companion I'd cheerfully have killed with a rusty harpoon. Loud, brash, opinionated and sometimes borderline cruel as he imposes himself on the group swearing as he goes. Gradually, though, we discover that both men have shields up; both are dealing with some fairly deep psychological issues in their own way and even ought these may clash, there is still far more fundamentally connecting them that not. There are ample opportunities to see the sights of Warsaw, and there is an haunting few minutes at the Majdanek camp where shoes, thousands and thousands of shoes, make you shiver. It's potent and it's often funny, darkly so, and in many ways it slots nicely into the recent panoply of dramas about the fascination by younger generations in the horror of war that those who endured actually want to get past and forget. It also shines a light on the whole business of tourism around these monuments, and does make it quite clear that sometimes these trips can become a statistical box-ticking exercise, especially for Americans, who want to say they've ""done"" that. An architectural monument equivalent of a safari ""big five"". In the end I found ""Benji"" to be a vulnerable but fundamentally selfish and unlikeable character - but I bet there are many reading this who profoundly disagree. That's proof that these two did their job well and I'd recommend you go see it in a cinema for a couple of powerful and characterful performances.",7.0
1013850,A Real Pain,"<em>'A Real Pain'</em> is a real solid watch. It makes up for its no-frills with plenty of heart and a meaningful buddy road trip. It's described as a comedy-drama and it is, though I'd say it's more the latter than the former; albeit with a still sizeable dose of comedy, it is amusing.

Kieran Culkin is the reason for the aforementioned, he is the star of this particular show and is funny throughout - though when he has to play more serious, he does to very good effect. Jesse Eisenberg (also dir.) acts alongside, he plays his character really well too. Two strong performers! Will Sharpe and Kurt Egyiawan are good too.

1118031,Apocalipsis Z: el principio del fin,"In spite of a exciting trailer Apocalypse Z fails to deliver. 

Perhaps the most immediately noticeable negative is the tiresome need to play politics. An anti-Russian sentiment is front and centre, throughout a large chunk of this film.

Looking beyond this, it takes far too long for what is essentially an action movie, akin to say ""World War Z"", to get off the ground. This film drags, at times, with sporadic moments of action, that never really amount to anything satisfying. 

In summary, if more emphasis had been placed on crafting a compelling story rather than playing politics, this might have amounted to a decent film.Certainly the cast is strong and the acting's excellent but on its own, its simply not enough. A mediocre watch, at best.",5.0
957452,The Crow,"I think the best plan of attack for this film is to forget all about Brandon Lee's 1994 version and treat this as a stand-alone vehicle for Bill Skarsgård to show off his ninja skills. He's ""Eric"" who encounters ""Shellly"" (FKA twigs) and is then promptly embroiled in the devilish machinations of ""Roeg"" (Danny Huston) who ensures that his hench-woman ""Marion"" (Laura Birn) kills them both. Turns out, though, that ""Eric"" still has enough purity of soul left to return to the land of the living and so long as he is touched by true love's kiss sort of thing, will remain immortal long enough to avenge the couple. Yes, there is a crow - the embodiment of his spirit when he goes on his murderous spree, but that whole theme isn't at all developed so let's just forget about that and revert to the whole point of the film - an excuse to pack loads of slaughter, acrobatics and dark, eerie photography into all but two hours of repetitious mediocrity. The camera likes Skarsgård well enough, and there's certainly plenty of him to see here as he takes on all comers. Why were they killed though? Who is ""Roeg""? Sure, you can put your own interpretation onto the story if you can be bothered, but director Rupert Sanders has almost entirely focussed on the gloomy and very wet imagery and decided against putting any meat on the bones of the story or the characters. There's a welcome paucity of dialogue throughout and FKA clearly twigged there wasn't much for her to do here so leaves much of the film to her co-star trying his best to be an amalgam of ""John Wick"" and ""Selene"" from ""Underworld"" (2003). It does look good but hasn't an original feather in it's body. It's nice to see Josette Simon (remember ""Blake's Seven""?) on the big screen, albeit briefly, but this is really all very disappointing.",6.0

Still, this version of the highly regarded 1994 picture isn't all that, I'm afraid. it almost feels like something completely different, they could've altered a few minor things and made an entirely original film to be honest. I found the pacing to be particularly off, while the antagonist(s) are extremely plain throughout.

I do have some positives. Bill Skarsgård and FKA Twigs make for a solid pairing, I sensed enough chemistry between them and both their performances are satisfactory. The music is decent, while some of the kills are creatively done and well shown onsreen.

957452,The Crow,"WOW this is awful. I remember the original Crow film with Brandon Lee (who sadly passed away making the film), which was reasonable but this so called remake, is, simply put, a cinematic train wreck. 

Eric (The Crow) is, it seems, not really the main character (he's elbowed aside by his drug addict, criminally linked, ex prostitute girlfriend). Apparently Eric, not to be entirely outdone however, is also a drug addict. Both he and the upcoming love interest attend a drug rehab centre, where everyone dresses like extra's from a Pink Panther movie. Oh and poor Eric's a wuss, who's bullied until he and his lady friend escape, have a tryst and are promptly croaked by some bad guys, who are after his dodgy lady friend. At this point and for reasons that seem, to say the least, far fetched, Eric is resurrected, as a mostly inept, anti hero tasked with seeking revenge. 

Suffice to say, this remake is filled with characters who are deeply unlikable and a central plot that's not only weak tea but make's little rational sense. Backed by a so called love story, that's about as appetising, as a two week old bowl of clam chowder.

In summary, the original The Crow film from way back when is a cinematic masterpiece, when compared to this dismal retake. In my opinion, one to avoid.",2.0
1029955,Kinds of Kindness,"This latest effort from the quirky imagination of Yorgos Lanthimos employs the services of Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons and Willem Dafoe in varying roles across three short stories that question just about every aspect of human behaviour and attitudes. The first (my favourite) sees Plemons as ""Robert"". He is an outwardly professional man who lives with is wife ""Sarah"" (Hong Chau) and works for ""Raymond"" (Dafoe). He has just recovered from a very slight car accident - and on meeting with his boss we discover a little more of just what that was about and of the somewhat curious nature, and dependencies, of their relationship. The second didn't engage with me so well as cop Plemons is ""Daniel"" struggling to deal with the loss of his wife ""Liz"" at sea. When she turns up somewhat unexpectedly, she appears completely different somehow and some fairly ghastly sacrifices are soon necessary before anyone can see any light at the end of this emotional maelstrom of a tunnel. Finally, the two share the leads more looking for the ideal candidate for a cult run by ""Omi"" (Dafoe). Candidate for what? Well so long as she is the right weight and her breasts are equidistant from each other and her navel, then it'd doesn't seem to matter... Thing is, she has an estranged husband (Joe Alwyn) and a daughter who are keen to have her back - and he is prepared to use some fairly ghastly methods to see she is ""contaminated"". The scenarios are quite hard to describe. They are surreal in places, brutal in others - but I found rarely entertaining. We are presented with the façades of characterisations but it's the questions their escapades pose to us that is more interesting. What might we do to satiate our cravings for love, affection and a sense of feeling needed? How easily led we can be. The things a person will do for a tennis racket smashed by John McEnroe in 1984! It's not that it blurs lines of sexuality. There aren't any. It's sexually fluid and frequently presents us with an environment where people behave according to instinct and not societal morals. Dafoe takes the acting plaudits for me, his ownership of his roles is unnervingly creepy at times. Stone, though, seems to be resurrecting her ""Pretty Little Things"" (2023) style of characteristic (lots of racing around taking short steps) and Plemons is adequate enough, but somewhat just a little too anodyne with roles that ought to have taken us more by the scruff of the neck. It also didn't really resonate with me as a comedy either. I could see where the humourous elements were supposed to be but I prefer my humour more subtle - these punches just didn't land well enough. It's a long old watch, and though at times I did enjoy it, I doubt I'd bother again.",6.0
1029955,Kinds of Kindness,"I’m going to say up front that this is a film I’m probably going to be processing for quite some time. The latest offering from writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos – best known for films like “The Lobster” (2015), “The Favourite” (2018) and “Poor Things” (2023) – is as much a puzzle as anything else. Told in three loosely interlaced stories with mostly the same cast members playing different roles in each, the film primarily deals in explorations of control and abuse examined from various angles. The individual stories plumb an array of additional subjects, including life, death, sanity, religion, cult membership, sexuality, dreams, surreality and self-indulgence, among others, most of which are tinged with exceedingly dark, macabre, cynical, satirical humor (evident even in its title) very much in the same vein as one of the filmmaker’s other, more troubling releases, “The Killing of a Sacred Deer” (2017). Unlike that mess of a picture, though, “Kinds of Kindness” is somewhat more coherently structured, both in its individual segments and overall, even though the finished product still has an overly cryptic eccentricity that could have benefitted from better delineated refinement. To be sure, “Kindness” has its strong points, such as its sardonic humor that may often have you giggling at things that you probably think you shouldn’t be laughing at. It also has strong performances from many of Lanthimos’s regulars, including Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe and Margaret Qualley, along with newcomers Hong Chau and Jesse Plemons, winner of the Cannes Film Festival Best Actor Award (though I can’t help but wonder what effect this film may have on the future of their careers, talent notwithstanding). And, much to my surprise, the pacing is fairly well sustained for a movie with a 2:45:00 runtime, probably because it holds viewer attention well, leaving audiences perpetually wondering where each of the vignettes is going next. On the downside, however, its graphic imagery, explicit sexuality, extreme violence and other questionable story elements may easily turn off some members (myself included at times), particularly when they push the limits of acceptability (sensitive viewers take note, especially animal lovers). So the bottom line questions here would be, “Did I like it?” and “Would I recommend it?” Well, that depends on how open one is to edgy content that clearly pushes the envelope. To be honest, there are things about this offering that I truly liked, but, then, my tastes tend to be more open-ended than those of many more conventional moviegoers. Because of that, however, this may consequently be seen as the kind of picture that many of those same audience members might find unduly troubling and offensive, readily labeling it as such and claiming that this is the sort of movie that gives many reviewers a bad name (and they probably wouldn’t be entirely wrong in saying that). Lanthimos has certainly pushed limits in many of his previous works, such as “Poor Things,” “The Lobster” and “The Favourite,” but the edginess of those releases had a playful, warmer, more whimsical feel to them than this outing, which is much more akin to the disturbing shadowiness of a film like “Sacred Deer.” Keep all of the foregoing in mind if you’re contemplating a screening of this one. And, in any event, if you come away from it outraged, disappointed or confused, don’t say you weren’t warned.",7.0
1029955,Kinds of Kindness,"I have only walked out on one other film in my life. It was warranted then and warranted when I walked out on Kinds of Kindness. I enjoyed Yorgos Lanthimos's previous film, Poor Things, also starring Emma Stone and Willem Dafoe. In my opinion, that film is a shining star in his filmography. Before that, I found most of his work to be beautiful and intriguing in premise but ultimately very dull. Kinds of Kindness is not just dull but completely boring with no real intrigue.

The movie is divided into three separate stories, all revolving around the initials 'R.M.F', which are used by many of the cast playing multiple characters. This narrative structure, intended to interweave various tales of absurd kindness and humanity, fails to deliver a cohesive or engaging storyline. The disjointed nature of these stories makes it difficult to form any emotional connection or investment in the characters' journeys.

Although I found all of the characters in this film just as boring as the movie overall, the ensemble cast does their best to bring distinctiveness to their roles. Each character played by the talented actors has their own nuances, highlighting their skill despite the weak material.

The biggest credit goes to the location scouts and art departments for providing beautiful scenery to an otherwise mundane movie. The visual composition of the film is stunning, with carefully chosen settings that enhance the aesthetic appeal.

I did return to finish the film a couple of days later so I could properly review it. Unfortunately, this did not change my initial impression. The film remained an exercise in tedium, with no scenes or moments that redeemed its slow pace and uninspired plot. Even the most beautifully shot scenes couldn’t hold my interest for long. The disjointed narrative and the lack of engaging content made it a struggle to sit through the entire film.",2.0
1029955,Kinds of Kindness,"Quite the thing! I really enjoyed <em>'Kinds of Kindness'</em>.

I'm also someone who loved <em>'Poor Things'</em> from these folk, so I guess me also liking this isn't any sort of surprise. It is a truly bizarre movie and I can see many disliking it, a thought supported by the fact that in a cinema with around 10 others alongside me, 3 left before the conclusion; 1 left at the end of chapter one, then a group of 2 left at the end of chapter two.

I'm personally absolutely cool with absurdity if the filmmakers truly commit to it, otherwise what's the point? Yorgos Lanthimos & Co. evidently did just that and I was thoroughly entertained across the entire run time, which is impressive given it lasts for almost three hours; it flew by for me.

I'm already a big fan of those onscreen so didn't need much convincing to see them act again, and I'm glad I did because all those acting here are great. Jesse Plemons is the standout in my eyes, what a terrific showing from that man - such a top actor! Emma Stone is, obviously, excellent as well, as is the awesome Willem Dafoe. Margaret Qualley, Hong Chau and Mamoudou Athie merit praise too.

Gotta get <em>'The Favourite'</em> watched at some point, all the while getting set for <em>'Bugonia'</em> - Stone x Lanthimos is where it's at!",9.0
1029955,Kinds of Kindness,"“I mostly loved it, but I kinda hated it” has pretty much become my mantra with the filmography of Yorgos Lanthimos, a writer/director whom most moviegoers will either loathe or adore. There are those of us who are firm fence sitters with his tales of absurdism and cruelty (although I skew towards the yay! versus the nay!), and it’s honestly a toss-up whether or not you’ll enjoy his latest bizarro project, “Kinds of Kindness.”

Written as a triptych fable that weaves together three distinct narratives, the film has layers upon layers of hefty, rich themes that are as thought-provoking as they are (at least on the surface) head-scratching. The first is a story of a man who has no choice in his life path, but is finally trying to stand up and take control of the direction his existence has been heading. The second is a totally weird tale of a policeman whose wife has gone missing at sea, but he becomes convinced that a doppelganger of her has returned home, where he delights in torturing her mercilessly. The final story is about a spiritual cult member who is determined to find a mysterious woman with a special ability who can lead the group to their destiny. It’s better to go in knowing as little as possible about the narrative, because the memorable surprises and general “WTF?” moments are also the film’s most successful.

As is the case with most of his former projects, Lanthimos once again gravitates towards the surreal, with unsettling stories that explore themes like fate, identity, free will, authority, power dynamics, and the complexities of human connection. It’s macabre and funny; dramatic and disturbing. The contemporary stories interconnect with a subtlety that’s incredibly well done through shared themes and recurring motifs, and the film blurs the line between dreamlike fantasy and harsh reality.

Further connecting the three stories together and keeping with coherent themes, Lanthimos keeps his cast small, utilizing the same actors (including Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, Willem Dafoe, Mamoudou Athie, Margaret Qualley, and Hong Chau) in different roles in each of the fables. Very few directors working today can consistently draw out exceptional performances from their actors, but Lanthimos is one of the true greats. Everyone is top-of-their-game terrific, with a jaw-dropping, standout turn from the limitlessly versatile (and immensely talented) Plemons.

Obviously, “Kinds of Kindness” isn’t a film that will appeal to everyone. With its existential musings, experimental narratives, abstract storytelling, and deliberate pacing, Lanthimos certainly does not cater to mainstream tastes. But the small segment of movie lovers at which this visionary project is aimed will be up to the challenge (and of course, absolutely delighted).

1029955,Kinds of Kindness,"The movie ""Kinds of Kindness"" was a perplexing and convoluted film that left me scratching my head. Clocking in at over three hours, it has earned the reputation of being the ultimate headache-inducing movie due to its scattered narrative.

Initially, the film showed promise with its stellar casting and intriguing storyline. I found myself drawn into the characters and their interactions, particularly with the protagonist's boss. However, as the plot unfolded, it spiraled deeper and deeper into confusion, leaving me feeling exhausted and questioning how much more I could bear.

Honestly, I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this film. It won't clean your house like a vacuum, that's for sure. It's the kind of movie that makes you say, ""No thanks, I'll pass."" Unfortunately, that's all I can really say about it. The only standout aspect was Emma Stone's portrayal of a sexually driven character, which left me wondering about her choice of roles. Perhaps she's chasing an Oscar by taking on such provocative characters, but it left me more puzzled than impressed.",3.0
1029955,Kinds of Kindness,"Kinds of Kindness is a thought-provoking film that explores themes of affection, toxic love, and the complexities of human relationships. Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, the film presents three interconnected stories that delve into the darker sides of kindness and cruelty.

My experience with the movie was a mix of fascination and discomfort. The cinematography is striking, capturing both beauty and bleakness, which enhances the storytelling. While some moments are deeply unsettling—featuring elements like cannibalism and self-mutilation—the film's exploration of abuse and its impact is handled with a level of depth that kept me engaged.

The writing is sharp, filled with dark humor that contrasts with the serious themes, making it an intriguing watch despite its almost three-hour runtime. However, I found that the film's forced weirdness sometimes detracted from its emotional core.

Overall, Kinds of Kindness is a unique cinematic experience that challenges viewers to reflect on the nature of kindness itself. It's not for everyone, but those who appreciate unconventional storytelling may find it rewarding.

""We Live in Time is a testament to the power of cinema that transcends the simplicity of its story with a moving, complex approach to the central themes of human existence.

John Crowley and Nick Payne deliver a narrative where form and content harmonize, using a nonlinear structure not as a mere stylistic gimmick but as an invitation to reflect on how time, memories, and personal choices shape who we are and who we love. With sublime, heartfelt performances from Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh, audiences are guided through a delicate, authentic study of love, loss, and the fragility of our connections.

In the end, it leaves a bittersweet feeling: the remembrance of the fleeting beauty of shared moments and the inevitability of time that shapes and erodes everything.""

Rating: A-",8.0
1100099,We Live in Time,"Suffice to say that ""Tobias"" (Andrew Garfield) isn't having a good day. He is sitting alone in an hotel room without even a biro to sign his newly arrived divorce papers. He sets off to rectify that but en route back unexpectedly (and painfully) encounters successful chef ""Almut"" (Florence Pugh) before he awakens, in a fetching neck-brace, in an hospital corridor. That's the tentative beginning for what becomes quite an engagingly portrayed love story that manages to marry quite a bit of humour with some tragedy, tension and toilet-floor activity as we are presented with two characters who might resonate with the viewer more than many. The story itself isn't really anything new. What makes this work is the dynamic between Garfield and Pugh. His is a more understated role, her's the more forceful - but both complement the other really quite effectively as the threads of their respective stories and of their burgeoning relationship are quite poignantly interwoven into a current timeline that has already pretty much telegraphed the inevitability of the denouement to us. It's that chemistry that rings true and even though the travails are rather piled up on the couple, their solutions to many of their issues are plausibly played out amidst some affection, temper tantrums, selfishness, tears and fine dining. Lee Braithwaite appears sparingly but quite usefully as her commis ""Jade"" who manages to allow us all to take the occasional breather from the increasing intensity of the plot, but essentially this is a two-hander that tugs gently at the heart-strings, but is not a film that oozes sentimentality. Always crack an egg on flat surface!",7.0

1100099,We Live in Time,"<em>'We Live in Time'</em> is painfully brilliant. I had no clue what this was about, aside from its romantic comedy-drama genre, so went into it blind and, let me tell you, I was sold within the first few scenes. The acting from the two leads right at the beginning is just incredible.

That's only initially too, because the performances of Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield are sensational all the way through; some of the best acting I've seen for a while, their chemistry is absolutely on point. They are two people I already enjoy, but this is undoubtedly the best work I've seen from them thus far.

The film holds a heavy plot, though does an excellent job at making the highs high and the lows low. The non-linear narrative can be a bit back and forth, but I personally felt like the timeline largely spoke for itself anyway; all becomes clear. There's much emotion packed in there.",10.0
704239,The Union,"Cringe worthy isn't a phrase I use that often. That said, I feel it fits The Union, nicely.

""Team USA"" rules the world in this pungent mix of pro US political monolithic ideology and folksy, jokery, ""aw shucks"", hometown America.  Yes the CIA are once again, the ""good guys"" (try not to laugh), inexplicably needing help from your average US working class citizen Joe, in order to save the world. The ""world"", in this case, being the bubble of exceptionalism, the US establishment inhabits.  

As a reviewer and viewer, I honestly could not stomach this. I watched about half before undeniable feelings of moral nausea overcame me and I switched it off. 

Is there an upside? Perhaps if you are from the US and believe all of this ""somehow"", then I suppose its an okay action spy thriller watch. Certainly, Mark Wahlberg is as likeable as ever and the actions not badly done, either. 

In summary, this might fly with certain US demographics but I don't see it playing too well, with audiences in other parts of the world, who have seen what the US establishment really stands for. I'll pass.",4.0

In the end, it's an experience that will hardly leave a lasting mark on viewers.""

956842,Fly Me to the Moon,"""Cole Davis"" (Channing Tatum) is the launch director at Cape Canaveral and is charged with getting the Apollo 11 mission to the moon (and back!). Thing is, with the Vietnam war in full swing the public have rather lost interest in the space race with the USSR. Presidential adviser ""Moe"" (Woody Harrelson) hits on the idea of bringing in marketing specialist ""Kelly"" (Scarlett Johansson) to spruce things up and get the public - and the US Senate - more engaged with the project before it runs out of money and impetus. She's pushy and brassy and ""Cole"" hates her! Thing is, though, he also starts to realise that she's not half bad at the hoodwinking game and seems to be making some headway engaging sponsors and senators alike with the aspirations of Messrs. Armstrong and Aldrin to set foot in the Sea of Tranquility. With public interest piqued, ""Moe"" realises that the last thing they need is a flop, so he tells ""Kelly"" to create a moonscape and get in her favourite director - ""Lance Vespertine"" (Jim Rash doing his best Stanley Tucci) to essentially make their own, terrestrial, version of the landings that can be shown to the public should the worst case scenario actually occur. With her and ""Cole"" becoming closer and the launch date now imminent, it's soon clear that this isn't just a contingency plan - and that might finally present the unflappable ""Kelly"" with a moral dilemma she can't easily shrug off. What to do? It's quite entertaining, this, with Johansson clearly enjoying herself playing a myriad of parts within her character and there's a decent spark with the better than usual Tatum as the story swipes at politics (largely thanks to a playfully devious effort from Harrelson) and advertising whilst we learn that she is not quite the woman she seems to be. At times the writing is quite funny and the whole thing offers lunar conspiracy theorists (and the disbelieving Soviets) the perfect opportunity for the mother of wet dreams. There's plenty of rocket photography and though maybe just twenty minutes too long, this is one of Apple's better and more creative efforts. You just have to love that mischievous black cat at the end!",7.0
956842,Fly Me to the Moon,"Not for me. I found <em>'Fly Me to the Moon'</em> to be a disappointment.

A sure sign of that being the case is that I don't have any positives for this movie. Well, OK, Scarlett Johansson is good, but there honestly isn't any other element to this that I can say I enjoyed. Johansson's co-star Channing Tatum feels miscast, I like the guy as an actor but here I didn't feel like he fit - visually his character didn't look or sound like someone out of the 1960s, in my eyes at least.

None of the support cast did anything for me either, though Woody Harrelson and Ray Romano are passable. Away from the cast, the story also didn't hold much interest for me. I feel like the moon landing bits, generally speaking, is all pretty standard and stuff we've seen before. The romance plot isn't merged in well, I didn't sense any chemistry between Johansson and Tatum. The music is also quite weak, almost TV-esque.

The run time is also too long, no way this 2024 flick needed to last over two hours! If I ignore all of that, then I guess I enjoyed it...",5.0
956842,Fly Me to the Moon,"“Fly Me to the Moon” is so generic and sanitized that it feels like a blanket, sterilized television sitcom designed to appeal to the masses in middle America. Director Greg Berlanti‘s throwback romance has its moments, but even the chemistry between the leads a few flashes of creativity can’t save the overlong, draggy film.

Set against the backdrop of NASA’s historic Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, former con artist Kelly (Scarlett Johansson) is hired by President Nixon’s clandestine staff member Moe (Woody Harrelson) to launch a marketing campaign on a mission that the White House has deemed too important to fail. Kelly has a huge job cut out for her, and her fiery personality, unconventional methods, and out-of-the-box ideas to fix the space agency’s public image wreaks havoc on the straight-laced launch director, Cole Davis (Channing Tatum). She’s in his way and is a major annoyance, but even Cole can’t deny the sparks that are flying whenever the two are in the same room.

The film works as a mid-level romantic comedy with Johansson and Tatum sharing an agreeable chemistry that, while not exactly electric, at least feels organic. Their playful banter and genuine affection shines, providing some of the film’s most enjoyable moments. It’s a classic odd couple pairing that adds much-needed comedic elements.

The script is messy and forgettable, with a lot of ineffective bids at humor. The most charming aspects are burdened by unnecessary subplots that detract from the main story, making the entire film feel far too long. Certain scenes drag on and on, especially when relying on clichés, predictable plot points, and tired tropes that fail to fully capitalize on the unique setting and wealth of historical context. So much more could’ve been done with this material in a much better way.

Although it provides some decent lighthearted entertainment, “Fly Me to the Moon” plays it so safe that it definitely falls short of its potential. It’s overstuffed and bland to a fault, struggling so mightily to be a crowd pleaser that it squanders most of the charm and authenticity that could have made it something truly special.

1008409,The Bikeriders,"Danny (Mike Faist) is a would-be journalist who is interviewing Kathy (Jodie Comer) who is married to Benny (Austin Butler) who is a member of the ""Valdals"". They are a motor cycle club run by Johnny (Tom Hardy) with an almost masonic approach to looking out for each other. She takes us back to how they met, and of her nervousness about mixing with this outwardly aggressive fraternity, but as she gets to know them and they her, she begins to understand they are no threat, and that in many ways are all the family the others will have/need. As time moves on, though, the ""Vandals"" become a victim of their own success and a proliferation of chapels emerges, introducing a younger more venal and violent element to challenge the existing status quo. Using the stresses and strains of their relationship as a bedrock for the chronology, we follow the ups and downs of this disparate gang and their leader. Sadly, this isn't really a film that catches fire. It's based on real characters, and upon the book written by Danny Lyon, but ""The Wild One"" (1953) it isn't. It's often as if we are just a small fly on the wall observing their day to day routines and dependencies, but we never really get to know the characters. Comer does fine, but she really serves as little better than the narrator rather than an impassioned character increasingly concerned for her husband's wellbeing. There's also precious little dialogue from either Butler or Hardy and the rigid structure of the drama makes it quite hard to empathise with any of them, really. There is also a dearth of action here. For all the bikes, leather and testosterone we are left with just one or two scenes that raise the pulse a little - and they have been well exploited already in the trailing for the film. It's a good looking film but after all the hype, I was a bit disappointed with it's shallowness.",6.0
1008409,The Bikeriders,"It’s a bit light on story, but <i>‘The Bikeriders’</i> is a film I enjoyed.

The stellar cast list is probably the main reason, because everyone onscreen do great work. Austin Butler and Jodie Comer are the obvious standouts as leads, both are good value throughout; even if the latter’s accent is slightly grating at a few moments. Tom Hardy is, as always, terrific too, while it was awesome to see Norman Reedus appear.

As noted, I do think there’s just barely enough there for a movie - it is a plot that is stretched as far as it could possibly be. It is all shot well and all that, the bikes look and sound ace. I also like how the film wraps up. All in all, it’s very good and most certainly worth a watch.",8.0
1008409,The Bikeriders,"The Bikeriders presents an interesting Shakespearean kind of tale, depicting the story of 'The Vandals' Motorcycle Club. The narrative captures the essence of motorcycle club culture, showcasing moments that resonate as authentic and familiar. Each scene featuring the club members is compelling, particularly those with Tom Hardy's Johnny and Austin Butler's Benny, whose performances are truly fantastic.

Tom Hardy and Austin Butler deliver standout performances that elevate the film. Hardy brings a raw intensity to Johnny, capturing the character's complexity and inner turmoil. For instance, scenes where Johnny grapples with leadership decisions reveal Hardy's ability to convey vulnerability beneath a tough exterior. Butler, on the other hand, exudes charisma as Benny, making his character's journey both engaging and poignant. His chemistry with Hardy is palpable, adding depth to their on-screen relationship.

However, Jodie Comer's character, Kathy, poses some challenges. While Comer’s acting is solid, the direction and certain choices surrounding her character are problematic. Kathy’s accent is particularly distracting, detracting from the immersion of her scenes. This is less noticeable during her interactions with the club members but becomes glaringly obvious in scenes where she talks to the photographer documenting the club. These segments, intended to provide narrative bridges or twists, feel awkwardly inserted and disrupt the flow of the story.

The decision to have Kathy narrate the story while speaking to the reporter, who is based on the real-life author of the book the film is adapted from, feels misplaced. It might have been more effective to narrate from the reporter's perspective or tell the story in a straightforward manner. For example, a linear narrative would have maintained continuity and made the time jumps less jarring. The disjointed structure often breaks the momentum, making it difficult to stay fully engaged with the plot.

Despite these issues, the core story of The Bikeriders remains compelling. The film captures the camaraderie, conflict, and emotional highs and lows of life within a motorcycle club. The writing, though disjointed due to the non-linear timeline, still conveys the drama and intensity of the characters' lives. A more linear approach could have enhanced the storytelling, providing a clearer and more cohesive narrative arc.

Overall, The Bikeriders is a film with a lot of potential, highlighted by outstanding performances from Tom Hardy and Austin Butler. Their portrayal of Johnny and Benny injects the film with energy and emotional depth. However, the film is hampered by narrative choices and distracting elements, such as Kathy’s accent and the fragmented timeline. While these issues don't entirely diminish the story's impact, they do detract from the overall experience. The film is worth watching for its strong character portrayals and the authentic depiction of motorcycle club culture, but it could have been more powerful with a more straightforward narrative approach.",6.0

1008409,The Bikeriders,"“The Bikeriders” offers a gritty and atmospheric portrayal of a Midwestern motorcycle club’s transformation over a decade, capturing both the allure and peril of a subculture defined by rebellion and camaraderie.

Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, the film delves into themes of loyalty, brotherhood, and the evolution of identity amidst a changing America, and features terrific performances from Jodie Comer, Austin Butler, and Tom Hardy. While not a true story, the movie is inspired by a 1963 photo essay and book by Danny Lyon, a photographer who spent time with the Chicago Outlaws riding club in an effort to document the life and times of the American biker. Nichols creates a fictional world inspired by a culture that was a very real part of the Sixties.

Set against the backdrop of a tumultuous era in American history, the film introduces bad boy Benny (Butler), a newcomer to a local motorcycle club called the Vandals. Led by the enigmatic Johnny (Hardy), the club initially serves as a sanctuary for misfits and outsiders seeking a sense of belonging in a world that seems to have left them behind. In other words, Benny fits right in. Most of the narrative revolves around his complex relationship with the strong-willed Kathy (Comer) and the tug of war that ensures between Benny’s allegiance to the club and his feelings for his old lady.

It’s a story of love, loyalty, identity, and brotherhood that’s filled with power struggles and eventual violence, and Nichols captures the heart of his narrative as the club and its members undergo a transformation that spans roughly a decade. The evolution of the characters can sometimes feel a little too predictable, but Nichols captures the spirit of the time with a sometimes-subtle (and sometimes not) exploration of the motorcycle club subculture and its various intricacies and complications.

One of the more surprising things I liked about this film is how it romanticizes masculinity in a way that’s reminiscent of classic Hollywood. Benny is a Brando type, with a rugged individualism that’s more muted than overpowered with a showy bravado. These are rugged, tough men, who abide by an unspoken code of brotherhood. It not only makes the characters more appealing, but it also adds to the authenticity.

Nichols visually captures the essence of his film’s setting too, immersing viewers in a world where leather-clad riders navigate the open road despite the turbulent dynamics within their own ranks. The production design and cinematography are a perfect fit, both working in tandem to enhance the gritty realism of the biker world and the allure of rebellion.

Anchored by solid performances and a nostalgic portrayal of American masculinity, “The Bikeriders” gives an effective and entertaining look at motorcycle culture.

All this is possible thanks to a captivating Nicole Kidman, an intimate script and direction by Halina Reijn and a production by A24, which as always never disappoints.",
1097549,Babygirl,"Business executive ""Romy"" (Nicole Kidman) is initially impressed with the dog-handling skills of ""Samuel"" (Harris Dickinson) but when she discovers that he is to be an intern in her e-packaging company something else starts to draw her to the man. We already know that though happily enough married to ""Jacob"" (Antonio Banderas) she's not exactly fulfilled in the bedroom department, and ""Samuel"" seems to sense that it's an area that maybe he can help with. Were not just talking sex, here - oh. no. This is about a lady with fantasy of being dominated. About her surrendering control completely, and if you're going to do that at all, then why not this tall, handsome and mischievous bit of rough? Of course, like any addiction - it starts to get out of control as the relationship dynamic changes quite profoundly and others start to put two and two together. At times this is quite funny, and milk seems to play a central role from time to time, but as a cinematic version of something akin to tantric, it doesn't really work. Neither of these actors are afraid to get naked yet neither do, simultaneously, here. Indeed I'm sure I saw his black Calvin's shining from under the sheet when the intimacy consultant was at their busiest. I didn't need nudity to augment their unique sort of passion, but I did expect something way more natural, visceral even, and I didn't get it. It's filmed in such a disjointed and bitty fashion, there's no attempt to characterise or contextualise either of these people and in the end I felt like this was little better than a titillation for it's stars that didn't really aspire to engage those watching any more than age-related porn might. Dickinson isn't remotely charismatic and the premiss falls flat quickly, especially when the quite aggravating intervention of ""Esme"" (Sophie Wilde) rather summed the shallowness of the whole thing up. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (1999) or ""Beach Rats"" (2017) showcase both their talents amidst a sexually charged environment far better: this is all forgettable, over-hyped, stuff.",6.0
1097549,Babygirl,"<em>'Babygirl'</em> is sex and bugger all else. It features two of the more freaky characters in cinematic history, they both kinda creeped me out I'm not going to lie - I will never look at a tie in the same way again, or a glass of milk for that matter. Kudos for creativity, I guess!

Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson do commit to their respective roles, some of the noises coming out of the former were quite something to witness. In fairness, if this is what they were going for then both actors do a fine job. Antonio Banderas is at least there to add sort of normality.

Impressively, aside from a few nips, there isn't much nudity in this, how you show so much without showing barely anything is actually quite the thing.

Also we are expected to believe that she would cheat on Antonio Banderas with this weird looking lanky kid that doesn't know how to comb his hair?",4.0
1097549,Babygirl,"Babygirl (2024) is yet another attempt at making a “provocative” drama that leans too much on surface-level shock value rather than compelling storytelling. The plot, if you can call it that, revolves around an imbalanced relationship dynamic that lacks any real emotional depth. There is no real buildup, no effort to make the audience care about these characters beyond their physical interactions, and certainly no originality. The film tries to be daring, but instead, it feels like a predictable series of events with little payoff.

The directing is uninspired, relying on overused shaky cam techniques that have no business in a drama like this. The cinematography does nothing to elevate the story, and at times, it feels like the camera is as lost as the script. The only real standout performance comes from Antonio Banderas, but he’s barely in the movie. Nicole Kidman, despite her talent, is stuck in a role that feels more about aesthetics than substance. And of course, we have the usual over-the-top praise for a “bold sexualized performance,” the same kind of overhyped reaction we saw with Demi Moore in Substance, as if established actors being in explicit scenes somehow qualifies as groundbreaking cinema.

The script is painfully weak, with dialogue that does little to make the characters feel real or relatable. The film spends too much time trying to push a message without taking the time to craft an engaging narrative. There are moments where it seems like it might go somewhere interesting, but then it falls back into the same repetitive themes. The pacing is another issue, dragging through unnecessary moments while rushing past anything that could have added depth.

The score is outright annoying. It doesn’t complement the film or enhance any of the scenes, it’s just there, adding to the discomfort in all the wrong ways. In the end, Babygirl tries to be provocative but lacks the intelligence or creativity to make an impact. It’s the kind of movie that confuses shock value with substance, leaving you wondering what the point of it all was.",2.0
636706,Spaceman,"From time to time, a movie comes along that’s hard to define, and, hence, it’s hard to know what to make of it. Such is the case with the second feature outing from filmmaker Johan Renck, a director best known for TV commercials and music videos, a reputation that bleeds through at times in this production. Viewer opinions and interpretations of this one are all across the board, making “Spaceman” one of the most challenging releases to peg in recent memory. This space-faring sci-fi release tells the tale of an astronaut (Adam Sandler) on a solo, long-term deep space mission to investigate a mysterious anomaly. However, he’s experiencing a profound sense of loneliness that’s distracting him from carrying out his quest, in large part because of marital troubles with his pregnant wife (Carey Mulligan) back on earth. As he seeks to sort out these matters, though, he’s further sidetracked by the unexpected appearance of an enigmatic alien that resembles a large nimble spider (voiced by Paul Dano) who possesses a profound philosophical wisdom. But how will all of this shake out, and what effect will it have on the mission? This scenario makes for an intriguing premise, but what exactly is the filmmaker’s intent in carrying it out? There are mixed tonal aspects here, some of which seem sincere, with others that come across as cheeky and cheesy, as if the director is giving the audience a good, sidelong wink. Indeed, it’s often difficult to tell which way the narrative is supposed to go. And, if straddling the fence is the real intent, it doesn’t quite work. So where does that leave us? I suppose it’s up to viewers to decide for themselves, but that seems shamelessly noncommittal. Based on the film’s attributes alone, there are good arguments for and against this offering. For instance, its ample metaphysical and philosophical insights are cogently presented and easy to understand, even if a bit saccharinely encrusted at times. It also represents a promising step up for Sandler’s attempt at reinventing himself as an actor in search of more substantive roles than the inanely silly parts he’s best known for. And the picture’s numerous deftly placed allusions to other sci-fi/fantasy projects enhance the narrative nicely, as seen in homages to “Interstellar” (2014), “Solaris” (2002), “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (2022) and even the lyrics to David Bowie’s Space Oddity. However, tedious pacing, occasionally poor sound quality and less-than-stellar visual effects (especially in the alien’s supremely tacky appearance) get in the way, further adding to the inherent overall ambiguity noted earlier. This one is thus up to you – and don’t be surprised if you come away from it with a different interpretation than what’s written here.",6.0
636706,Spaceman,"In director Johan Renck’s science fiction fantasy “Spaceman,” adapted from Jaroslav Kalfař’s 2017 novel Spaceman of Bohemia, viewers are taken on a philosophical journey into the depths of one man’s self-inflicted loneliness that manifests as a nightmarish friendship with a giant space spider. It takes a lot of guts to attempt a screen adaptation of such an abstract story, but Renck pulls it off, mostly with the help of a strong lead performance from Adam Sandler.

Dubbed “the loneliest man in the world,” Jakub (Sandler) is six months into a solitary mission to investigate a mysterious phenomenon that lies on the edge of the solar system. Realizing the wife (Carey Mulligan) and marriage he left behind will likely not be there waiting upon his return, his desperation to repair the relationship grows. One day, Jakub discovers a giant alien spider he calls Hanuš (voice of Paul Dano) hiding in the ship. With the new companion on board, he develops an unlikely kinship and intense emotional bond with the creature.

This is a story about two lonely travelers who find comfort in each other. They share deeply profound conversations about the nature and meaning of life, love, death, and the sting of regret and grief that can overpower a person’s existence. Jakub’s ambition has destroyed his life and his relationship, and his grip on reality is drifting away (there possibility is left open for viewers to decide if Hanuš is imaginary or indeed real). The spider can somehow read Jakub’s mind and access his life’s memories, and there’s a lot of hurt and emotional turmoil that’s been building up for decades. It’s a story of what it means to be human, but also one of companionship and mutual understanding.

The effects crew did a bang-up job animating Hanuš, and the spider looks and feels real both physically (with his glossy eyes and hairy body) and emotionally (thanks to a moving voice performance from Dano). The spider is authentic with sympathy and companionship, and the friendship that develops between Hanuš and Jakub, whom he affectionately calls “skinny human,” is genuine. Sandler is an accomplished dramatic actor (something that’s easy to forget), and he is absolutely great here, depicting a tormented soul that’s well-worn with loneliness.

Pensive and poignant, “Spaceman” isn’t going to be for everyone. There’s no denying that it’s a very weird film, but there is an abundance of thoughtful reflection about the struggle with confronting loneliness that’s told in a highly creative way.

""Upgraded could have been an inoffensively formulaic, forgettable rom-com that borrows from hundreds of other similar movies, but the frustratingly simplistic conclusion with terrible messaging - basically conveying the idea that lying has no negative consequences, quite the opposite - ruins the hopes of a recommendation for fans of the genre.

A predictable story from the first second without an ounce of creativity and with a complacent resolution to all the protagonist's problems. Camila Mendes and Marisa Tomei deserve more than the worst film of 2024 to date.""

He becomes besotted with her, but rather than buy her her favourite “The Cure” album, he pinches it for her, and that’s just the latest example of his petty criminality that ultimately ends up with him spending ten years incarcerated. When he (now François Civil) comes out of prison, he goes back to his old stomping grounds to get paid and perhaps to hook back up with her, but he finds that nothing he left behind is as it seems and with violence never far from him he knows that change is the only way he can perhaps be reconciled with a “Jackie” (now Adèle Exarchopoulos) who has had not had her own troubles to seek since he went away. She is now living with her boss “Jeffrey” (Vincent Lacoste) but fairly clearly for convenience rather than affection. Can there be a future for the childhood sweethearts? This is a tightly cast and gritty action drama that does follow quite a predictable story arc, but it also does benefit from four really quite impressive performances as it combines the throes of young love with the conflict brought by the sense of the hopeless felt by “Clotaire” as he starts to take the only path he feels is open to him. There isn’t so much dialogue with this, which I think helps, and the 1980s soundtrack also helps give us a sense of their occasion as they mature at different speeds and in wholly different ways. It’s a film that’s about characters rather than their scenario, and though I can’t say I especially enjoyed the fizzling out at the denouement, it’s a solid feature that is worth a watch.",7.0
802219,Bob Marley: One Love,"It's fine, just nothing all that memorable.

I had a pleasant enough time viewing <em>'Bob Marley: One Love'</em>, though it does kinda seem a bit hollow post-watch - as in I don't feel like I've learned much nor actually seen that much, the movie has like three noteworthy events but then that's kinda it. The music from those involved also didn't feel amazingly utilised, I guess they didn't want it to be too jukebox-y.

Kingsley Ben-Adir does well in the lead role as Bob Marley himself. I'm not a Marley superfan or anything close, I basically only know his biggest hits, but the resemblance of Ben-Adir seemed off to me - a thought that was only solidified when the real Marley appears via archive footage at the end. Perhaps that's just me, though.

Lashana Lynch gives a good performance, spearheading the rest of the cast who are alright; interesting to see James Norton, Michael Gandolfini too... even if I didn't realise it was Gandolfini until the credits. Overall, it does feel like the film only scratches the surface of Marley's life. I wanted more from it, but to be fair it is still a decent flick in my opinion.",7.0
802219,Bob Marley: One Love,"Sadly, this is one of those films that shoves almost all of it's best bits into the trails. What's left is a curiously sterile representation of the life of this vibrant and visionary man. To be fair, Kingsley Ben-Amir does turn in quite a charismatic performance, but the rest of that characters are largely under-cooked and seem there to make up the numbers. We get little by way of establishment. Why is he revered on his home island of Jamaica at the start? We are plonked into the centre of a political hotbed and then all to briefly, bullets are flying and we are in London, his family in Delaware. Again, little meat on the bones of context there for us to understand just what was going on and why he was so important to both sides in that conflict - alive or dead. The last twenty minutes does allow for more of his musical talents to shine, and KBA delivers them enthusiastically and engagingly, but somehow I just felt this was the thinnest of coats about his enigma. James Norton just looked like he was along because he liked the music and Lashana Lynch is totally unremarkable too. Son Ziggy may well have had a hand in this, but it really under-delivers on a story that I thought should have been a no-brainer politically, musically and culturally. Sorry, this is just a rather disappointing chronology that skirts across his life like a stylus on well worn vinyl. Pity.",6.0

""Bob Marley: One Love navigates the intricacies of biographical storytelling with mixed success. Its commendable focus on Marley’s message and music, coupled with good performances, highlights the enduring relevance of his legacy.

However, the reluctance to engage with the more contentious aspects of his life and the oversimplification of his political contributions undermine the potential for a more nuanced, complete exploration.

While the movie serves as a vibrant homage to Marley’s spirit and artistry, it ultimately leaves me yearning for a deeper, more critical study of the complexities that defined one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.""

802219,Bob Marley: One Love,"In addition to telling an individual’s life story, one of the other primary objectives of a film biography is to provide insight into the protagonist’s character and nature. Unfortunately, that’s where this profile of reggae icon Bob Marley (Kingsley Ben-Adir) tends to come up somewhat short. Director Reinaldo Marcus Green’s biopic about the legendary musician and peace advocate provides viewers with a somewhat scattershot and episodic look at the artist’s life, primarily focused on the last few years of his life, intercut with flashbacks that are largely inserted without explanation and don’t come across as especially insightful or enlightening. To the film’s credit, it features a fine repertoire of Marley’s music, including the origins of many of his works, as well as fine performances by Ben-Adir and Lashana Lynch as the musician’s wife, Rita. However, I came away from this offering feeling as though I didn’t know a lot more about its subject than I did going in, particularly since many story threads are raised but never sufficiently resolved. It also probably didn’t help that the film’s sound quality (in the non-musical sequences) left much to be desired, often resulting in the need to strain to hear and comprehend the dialogue. In many ways, “One Love” feels like a missed opportunity to tell the story of someone who had much to say but whose message doesn’t come across nearly as clearly as it could and should have. Listen to Marley’s music instead – you’ll get more out of one of his albums than you’re likely to absorb from this picture.",5.0

The aspects of the film are related to the themes of misogyny and violence and how women deal with strange men.

""Megalopolis is an ambitious epic that attempts to examine numerous thought-provoking themes, but Coppola's vision of societal reconstruction reflects both its grandeur and the inherent flaws of its chaotic execution.

Despite immersive visuals and a talented cast, the narrative becomes overloaded with metaphors and philosophical analogies, resulting in an experience that, while provocative, feels confusing and scattered.

592831,Megalopolis,"In the interest of full disclosure, it pains me to write this, but I feel I must be honest. Legendary writer-director Francis Ford Coppola’s long-awaited epic cinematic fable is, regrettably, a major disappointment. After decades of stop-and-start development, the filmmaker’s metaphorical opus about a renowned, idealistic architect (Adam Driver) seeking to build an ambitious utopian development in a modern-day version of New York inspired by ancient Rome follows the protagonist’s often-frustrated efforts to get the project off the ground (not unlike the production of this movie itself). Thematically speaking, the picture addresses a number of thoughtful, significant issues about the roles of greed, corruption, politics and agenda-based motivations in matters of public welfare, as well as the importance of enabling the expression of inspired creative freedom. It also delves into the relevance of love and support in fueling the success of such ventures. However, these notions are severely undermined by an overwhelming abundance of narrative clutter and style over substance. While it’s true that “Megalopolis” is gorgeous to look at with its inventive and impressive cinematography and production design, these visual aspects become so dominant that they vastly overshadow the coherence and intelligibility of the story. Admittedly, a greater sense of clarity begins to emerge as the picture unfolds, but, unfortunately, by that point, it’s difficult to imagine almost anyone genuinely caring about what ultimately happens. There are also many less-than-subtle parallels between the plot of this film and the screen adaptation of author Ayn Rand’s best-selling novel “The Fountainhead” (1949), raising some questions about the authentic originality of this work. Given that this could well be Coppola’s final film, it’s a shame to see the director wind up his repertoire with such a disappointing and underwhelming effort, and some reviewers (myself included) have tried mightily to avoid being unduly unkind, perhaps delivering more generous ratings than might ordinarily be the case. Nevertheless, it would appear that this allegorical undertaking was more than the filmmaker could manage, and it shows in the finished product, quite a letdown from the director known for such classic offerings as “The Godfather” (1972) and “Apocalypse Now” (1979). Yet, if you’re determined to see it, in light of the stunning visuals, this is probably a production best viewed on the big screen, but don’t be surprised if you walk away from this one disappointed overall.",5.0
592831,Megalopolis,"So imagine that the Roman Empire survived the turbulent treacheries of the original Caesars and made it to third millennium. (New) Rome has miraculously relocated to the United States (of course the greatest country the world has ever known) and the city is run by mayor ""Cicero"" (Giancarlo Esposito). He's not without his detractors, though, and one of them is the ambitious ""Cesar"" (Adam Driver) who has ambitions to reinvent their city, Nero-style, by demolishing the run down slums and replacing them with an idealistic utopia constructed of his new, eternally lasting, ""Megalon"". The city's vested interests are lined up against this young man though, all except the mayor's daughter ""Julia"" (Nathalie Emmanuel) who has taken a bit of a shine to the ambitious ""Cesar"" - and that's much to the chagrin of his previous squeeze ""Wow"" (Aubrey Plaza) who decides that she will seek some vengeance by marrying the enormously wealthy, and aged, ""Crassus"" (Jon Voight). Add to this already rather cluttered mix, the personality of ""Clodio"" (Shia LaBoeuf) who is determined to bring down ""Cesar"" and see himself in public office - and inherit the ""Crassus"" fortune, and we have the makings of an internecine intrigue that ought to have made Suetonius and Machiavelli blush. Instead, well, we get a rambling drama that hasn't a clue where it's going - nor for whom it is for. It tries to mix a bit of the ancient Shakespeare (and Marcus Aurelius) into the dialogue to lend some gravitas and sense of history to the plot, but for the most part this is just a confused mess of a film. It's a toss up between LaBeouf as the the over-the-top, hammy, ""Clodius"" and Voight's doddery old gazillionaire as to who takes what acting plaudits there might be here, but the rest of the cast look like fish out of (CGI) water and though the production makes the odd to nod to cinema history - there's a tiny bit of Fritz Lang here, I though - the rest of this comes across as an ill-inspired vanity project for Francis Ford Coppola that can't decide if it's ""Romeo & Juliet"" or ""Spartacus"" and in the end doesn't deliver the potency, emotion, intensity or humour of either. It is a good looking film and the production designers have imaginatively created a city-scape that is ripe for the story, it's just that the story isn't ripe for the audience. It does need to be seen on a big screen, but be prepared to be underwhelmed as it starts strongly then simply peters out into a wordy melodrama with a few clumsily delivered messages about the nature of greed and the fecklessness of humanity lightly woven into the weak storyline.

592831,Megalopolis,"**_Colorful, eccentric, intellectually heavy and full of pizazz, but not for the masses_**

A brilliant architect (Adam Driver) is determined to recreate a core section of New Rome in the later 21st century with a revolutionary bio-adaptive material called Megalon. But the new mayor resists these creative plans because he’s content with the way things are (Giancarlo Esposito). As such, the mayor’s not happy when his daughter (Nathalie Emmanuel) starts to develop a relationship with the prodigy. Shia LaBeouf plays a decadent troublemaker while Aubrey Plaza appears as a scheming TV presenter drawn to the financial backbone of the city (Jon Voight). 

Francis Ford Coppola first came up with the idea for “Megalopolis” in 1977. It was inspired by Lucius Sergius Catiline’s failed attempt to take control of the Roman republic in 63 BC, but lost to his rival Marcus Tullius Cicero. Even though Francis compiled hundreds of pages of notes and script fragments for the project in early 1983, the first serious attempt to go forward with making the movie was in 2001-2002, but the production eventually froze for various reasons, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

When Coppola turned 80, he decided to throw caution to the wind and finally make the film, financing it himself at a cost of $120 million, with shooting taking place between November and March, 2022-2023. So, is it any good? Some critics call it a “big mess,” but the plot is actually simple, as detailed above. It’s Francis’ artsy style that throws people off wherein he respects the intelligence of the viewer to put the pieces together. This approach was evident in his previous pictures, like “One From the Heart,” “Rumble Fish,” “Bram Stoker’s Dracula,” “Youth Without Youth” and “Twixt” (aka “B-Twixt Now and Sunrise”). Speaking of those flicks, if you liked any of them, or hated ’em, this is cut from the same artistic cloth.

As observed with “Tucker: The Man and His Dream,” “Tetro” and even “Apocalypse Now” (the character of Kurtz), Coppola likes to parallel aspects of his own life in his movies. Here, he’s Cicero (Driver), an award-winning genius who has an ambitious new project that will revolutionize the landscape if carried out, but those in power oppose his noble efforts. He’s constantly slandered or framed with his indiscretions not helping matters. He’s also troubled by the death of his wife and his unborn children (remember the tragedy of Francis’ eldest son, Gian-Carlo, in 1986?). Yet he presses on with his vision and ultimately changes the world with his art.

At the end of the day, the movie’s entertaining on several fronts and stuffed with quality mindfood, not to mention it has a welcome warmhearted close. I busted out laughing on several occasions in light of the creative madness of it all. For those who say the amusement was “unintentional,” I guess they never saw Coppola’s previous film “Twixt,” not to mention earlier ones like “You’re a Big Boy Now.”

I see the city of Megalopolis as a type of the New Jerusalem in the Bible, the eternal city described in Revelation 21-22 (awesome streets of gold and all that). ""The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life"" and so the impenitent in the movie reap the wages of their transgressions whereas those who change their minds/thinking/actions (that is, they repent) are able to enjoy the benefits of the amazing new city.

If you value it, this is a flick you’ll be able to go back to for gems missed on previous viewings. 

It runs 2 hour, 18 minutes, and was shot in Manhattan and Trilith Studios, Atlanta.

While the world-building is interesting and primarily focus on the lives in a family, where the husband inadvertently caused his domestic robot to unbalance her goals towards making him ""calmer"" and ""happier"" over everything else, it also brings deeper elements for a reflexion on the effects in the work force and society once robots start replacing humans in work activities.

However, the premise for a blockbuster could not compensate a weak screenplay, at first excessively slow, and in the later parts of the movie unrealistic. Also, excepted a few actors doing a good job as bots (including Megan Fox), the acting from the human characters is overall awful, especially Michele Morrone's.

948549,Love Lies Bleeding,"There are few things worse in films than when a film tries too hard to be edgy. This fools some of the people some of the time. But...it also shows that the emperor really does have no clothes.

Kristen Stewart plays Lou, a gym worker who develops a crush on a female bodybuilder named Jackie. They begin a sexual relationship. Lou's father, played by Ed Harris is the town thug, and her sister is repeatedly abused by her creepy brother-in-law JJ (Dave Franco). Violence erupts and soon everyone is scrambling to cover up a murder.

The film starts out interesting enough as it builds the characters. By the second half it has begun spiraling as it shifts between so many tones that you don't know which ones to move with. A lot of unintentional laughs and head scratching get more frequent. By the end it is all out terrible.

Another serious problem is the way they treat abuse victims. The very people who are defending her...later in the movie are beating her. This is our hero?

Kristen Stewart is a good actress, but Ed Harris is by far the best thing in the movie. The problem is that none of the characters become well fleshed out. None of them are worth hoping for. I don't need my characters I watch to be pleasant, but they need to show some kind of attributes that make them worth following from start until finish.",3.0
948549,Love Lies Bleeding,"""Lou"" (Kristen Stewart) runs a gym on the basis of being as obnoxious to the customers (mostly brain-dead males) as she can until one night she espies a new visitor. She assumes that ""Jackie"" (Katy O'Brian) has gone off with the boys for a beer, but a chance encounter afterwards in the car park makes it clear they are both on the same team. We (the audience) have met ""Jackie"" already and know she's looking for work. That comes via ""JJ"" (Dave Franco) who takes her to the shooting range owned by the long haired and hippy looking Ed Harris who gives her a job as a waitress. Quickly we discover that ""JJ"" is married to ""Beth"" (Jena Malone) who is the sister of ""Lou"" and both are the daughters of Ed Harris. ""Lou"", though, is a bit estranged from him and as the plot thickens we discover why. Also, we discover that ""JJ"" is a bit of a thug and prone to beating up his wife. A trip to the hospital for her causes tempers to flare, and pumped full of steroids, it's the increasingly unstable ""Jackie"" who sets things in motion that are going to bring to an head a decade of family tensions, put lives at risk and even drag in the FBI. Aside from the same sex angle, there is nothing new at all to this half-hearted relationship drama that contrives to introduce just about everything to go wrong that can and in the end seems to be trying more to parody ""The Incredible Hulk"" than make headway with anything different. The denouement is weak and surreal on just about every level, too. Just because Rose Glass decides to feature loads of turbulent female bonding and making out doesn't make this worth watching. It just looks like a self indulgent and proud statement of sexuality for the sake of it, regardless of the strength or brutality of the story.

948549,Love Lies Bleeding,"I absolutely adored the bold and audacious “Love Lies Bleeding,” director Rose Glass’ sordid story of romance, violence, and redemption. Combining a lesbian love story with a brawny thriller, this gritty, bloody, and brash film was one of my favorites to come out of this year’s Sundance Film Festival.

Lou (Kristen Stewart), a reclusive gym worker who spends her days mopping floors, unclogging toilets, and laminating membership cards, is barely surviving her small-town existence. Her world transforms in an instant when the transient bodybuilder Jackie (Katy O’Brian) crosses her path. Lou falls hard for those rock hard muscles, and she invites Jackie to move in with her. Ambitious to a fault, Jackie begins training for a competition in Las Vegas (and starts injecting steroids at the encouragement of Lou). The plan is for the two to take an epic road trip out West, but a startling act of violence involving Lou’s sister (Jena Malone) and brother-in-law (Dave Franco) changes everything. The truth about Lou’s criminal family is revealed, further complicating not only her romance with Jackie, but pulling both women into a web of absolute mayhem.

Glass has created a film with a deliciously pulpy, crime thriller vibe. Her bold and distinctive style is reflected with a voice that practically screams with an underlying rage and intensity (and one of the best uses of magical realism I’ve ever seen in a movie). Lou and Jackie are flawed people, but you just can’t help rooting for their relationship. They are capable and guilty of some very, very bad things, but goddamn if these two aren’t meant for each other with their explosive love story for the ages.

Stewart and O’Brian deliver stunning performances, embodying their characters with a ferocious spirit that reflects the lust and desire of their tumultuous relationship. Their chemistry is palpable and intense, which lends an additional layer of authenticity to the story. The supporting cast is nothing short of terrific too, with effective turns from Anna Baryshnikov, Ed Harris, Franco, and Malone.

Passionate and provocative, “Love Lies Bleeding” is the type of film that gets under your skin. Beneath the violence and revenge, it’s a queer love story that’s hopelessly and breathlessly romantic.

Join ""tribe"" A (the beautiful brainwashed technocrats) or B (the alleged non conformists agrarians) and its collectivism, not individuality, whichever way you cut it. 

Action is alright, acting is alright and special effects seem reasonable. I think a certain youthful viewer may like it but perhaps fail to appreciate, what's missing from the conversation.  

In summary, I see no overly positive message here. Perhaps aside from a rather simplistic rejection of physiological stereotypes. Whats more important is the right to true individuality, which extends beyond the superficial, to meaningful things like free speech and free expression.

1000837,Ainda Estou Aqui,"Films featuring dark political themes are an acquired taste for many moviegoers, but, when they tell personal stories within such a context, they generally become more accessible for audience members, even those who might not ordinarily gravitate to pictures in this genre. That’s a goal expertly accomplished in the latest from director Walter Salles. This superb fact-based offering tells the heart-wrenching story of former Brazilian politician Rubens Paiva (Selton Mello) who, in 1971, was seized by, and subsequently disappeared at the hands of, the military dictatorship that overran in the country at that time. Paiva, who was working as an engineer when captured, was taken because of his liberal-leaning politics, especially in his clandestine efforts to assist those opposed to the oppressive policies and practices of Brazil’s hard-line right-wing authorities. His seizure subsequently led to the detainment of his wife, Eunice (Fernanda Torres), and daughter, Eliana (Luiza Kosovski), in an effort to find out who their husband and father may have associated with, as well as what activities he may have engaged in. This harassment by officials, though, was not enough to stop the determination of Eunice and her family from trying to find out what happened to their loved one. In telling this story, the filmmaker not only relates a tale of high suspense, but also presents a compelling chronicle of a family committed to remaining hopeful and uncovering the truth, no matter how horrendous it might ultimately prove to be. In carrying out this mission, “I’m Still Here” successfully fires on all of its cinematic cylinders, perpetually engaging viewers in a gripping, emotionally charged odyssey, not unlike the films of famed filmmaker Costa-Gavras, most notably “Missing” (1982). In my view, this is the film most deserving of this year’s Oscars for best picture, lead actress (Torres) and international picture, hands down, not to mention a bushel of overlooked nominations in other categories. By all means, do not pass this one up.",10.0
1000837,Ainda Estou Aqui,"The Paiva family leads an ordinary life until one night when a knock on their door changes things for ever. Rubens (Selton Mello) was formerly a Labour Party congressman in Brazil but now that the military have taken over, he is suspected of ties with the outlawed Communists. He is taken away and shortly after his wife Eunice (Fernanda Torres) and their elder daughter is also taken in for interrogation. For the next twenty minutes or so as she spends an intangible time in jail, we are exposed to some of the most effective cinematic menace I've ever felt. There is no graphic violence nor very little angry dialogue. Indeed, there isn't a great deal of actual physical threat at all. Her imprisonment and her deprivation of information is the stick they beat her with and it's profoundly traumatic. When she is released a week later, she returns home to find nobody has or will disclose any information about her missing husband. As time goes by she and their family have to come to terms with both the emotional and the practical implications as they try to look to the future, unsure of what's in their past. It's perhaps easy to forget amidst the militaristic history of 1970s South America that Brazil also had it's junta and it's fair share of bodies disappearing and that threat is never far away as the film proceeds to slowly follow her attempts to get to the truth, closure and to regain a positive sense of her own purpose. Torres is on great form here. She manages to imbue her characterisation with a fear but also with a sense of defiance. It's not reckless - she has a family to consider, but it's a determined effort to get to the facts, however unpleasant and however long it takes. The intensity of the main plot is diverted, occasionally, by the family and it's own aspirations and problems as they too must come to terms without a father whom they genuinely loved and by the denouement I felt quite drained by just the mere observation of their experiences. To live in a land where routine and permanent disappearances are every day occurrences is unrecognisable to most of us in the West. This reminds us to count our blessings.",7.0
1000837,Ainda Estou Aqui,"<em>'I’m Still Here'</em> undoubtedly merits praise, it's an astutely made picture regarding a dark time in Brazilian history. The film's biggest plus, for me, is how warmly they portray the Paivas, it genuinely feels as if you are watching a real family; the actors play a big part in that, of course.

Fernanda Torres is the standout, rightly so given she leads much of what we see. An excellent performance! Selton Mello sticks out too, as do all of the relatively younger cast members; e.g. Luiza Kosovski and Valentina Herszage. There isn't anyone onscreen who puts a foot wrong.

I will say that I don't think this needed to be a 138 minute movie, there are a couple of moments where I felt like it was going to conclude and it didn't. This isn't a major detail though, because it is a film of sturdy quality and is most definitely worth viewing.",8.0

The film benefits greatly from the expertise of its veteran stunt coordinator turned director, known for his work on Train to Busan. Commendable world-building, visionary concepts, and excellent VFX are hindered by conventional writing. The short, crisply edited runtime avoids unnecessary elements. Don Lee's exceptional portrayal of Nam-san, with exhilarating action sequences, overshadows the film's narrative weaknesses, making it a guiltily satisfying popcorn-worthy entertainer, particularly for adrenaline enthusiasts.

The movie stars Wyatt Russell and Kerry Condon as Ray and Eve Walter; a married couple trying to raise their two children and deal with Ray’s M.S.
diagnosis. Ray is a former Major League Baseball player and holds out hope that he can overcome his situation and make a return to his profession even if those around him do not.

A life on the road has caused Ray to miss many events such as the birth of their daughter as well as be distant from their son. A new job at a prestigious school offers Eve a chance to have the needed insurance for Ray and work to do while she completes her degree.

The family opt to purchase a home with a pool versus renting as the ability to finally have some stability and use the pool for therapy is a welcome combination. This is enhanced by the discovery that the pool is
actually filled by a natural water source which Ray believes is healing him and rapidly putting him on the road to recovery.

Things are not as they seem as the pool holds some dark and deadly secrets that go back for decades and the family soon finds themselves dealing
with forces beyond their control as they desperately try to survive.

The film has an interesting premise though at times I did think about various other films and some of the shock moments failed to get me as they did others in the audience but I am not one who startles easily.

The cast was strong but at times I found myself not caring as much for the outcomes of certain characters as I was more concerned with the overall
explanation behind the supernatural elements of the film.

Wyatt Russell and Kerry Condon are good in the lead roles, the latter is the stronger but well cast they both are.

1051896,Arcadian,"Its nice to see Nicolas Cage in a film deserving of his talents. 

Arcadian is not an exceptional horror thriller but what it does do, is done competently enough to be deserving of praise. It has a serviceable story, that reminds me a little of ""A Quiet Place"" from 2018. The core premise is not quite the same but the monster effects are similar, as is the rural setting. 

The tension is ratcheted up nicely as the story progresses. As is always the case with what is essentially a survivalist horror, we know the creatures are going to get in but what happens next is, of course, the interesting part. Along the way we get to know the key characters, including Cages father figure. His effective absence part way through film and his return near the end, is a little disappointing but given this film has a coming of age component, its understandable. 

Acting is decent throughout and you can certainly relate to the plight of Cages little ad-hoc family. The creature effects work well enough too but somehow, they are just not all that creepy or especially menacing. This tends to rob the film of a real post apocalyptic horror vibe. I think revealing exactly what they are, early on, was a mistake too that took away any reveal/jump scare potential, from the film.

No, I didn't say it was original, but it's quite well paced as the loved-up ""Thomas"" manages to get a bit too close to these nocturnal monsters which causes his father to get injured and requires ""Joseph"" - the brains of the family (who reminded me the entire time of Dan Radcliffe) to come up with some clever ruses to keep the whole lot of them alive. Cage barely features which is no bad thing here as the two boys and girlfriend ""Charlotte"" (Sadle Soverall) make a perfectly good job of keeping the thing moving along quickly and quite entertainingly for and hour and an half. The visual effects aren't the best, but the claustrophobic settings; the regular axe-wielding; a fair bit of burrowing and a the help of a chest freezer work fine. You'll never remember it, and quite what any of it has to do with Arcadia is anyone's guess, but for light and fluffy summer cinema, it works fine.",7.0
1051896,Arcadian,"As a long-time fan of Nic Cage, I went into Arcadian with high expectations. The trailer was intriguing, hinting at a familiar story with potential for new and exciting directions. However, the film felt like two different movies in one. While I enjoyed both aspects separately, they didn't blend well together.

The film starts with a grounded, realistic tone that sets up an engaging story. Nic Cage delivers a solid performance, immersing himself in a character that is both relatable and compelling. However, the narrative takes a sharp turn into absurdist territory, introducing elements that feel out of place in the established world. For example, the grounded scenes where Cage's character navigates personal challenges are suddenly juxtaposed with bizarre, otherworldly events that disrupt the film's coherence.

The grounded part of the story focuses on Cage's character dealing with real-world issues, offering a nuanced exploration of his psyche. This segment is filled with strong character development and emotional depth. In contrast, the absurdist elements, featuring creatures that seem to belong in a different genre, clash with the film's initial tone. 

While it's possible to successfully combine grounded and absurdist elements in a film, Arcadian struggles to achieve this balance. The creatures introduced do not fit seamlessly into the world we are shown, leaving many questions unanswered. The lack of cohesion between the two parts of the story makes it difficult for the audience to stay engaged. 

The film raises intriguing questions about the nature of reality and perception but fails to provide satisfying answers or connections between the disparate elements.

Despite its narrative shortcomings, Arcadian boasts solid acting and impressive cinematography. Nic Cage's performance is a highlight, bringing intensity and authenticity to his role. The cinematography enhances the film's atmosphere, capturing both the grounded and surreal elements with skill. 

Arcadian is a film with strong individual components that fail to coalesce into a unified whole. The acting and cinematography are commendable, but the disjointed narrative undermines the film's potential. To improve, a more seamless integration of the grounded and absurdist elements would be necessary, providing clearer connections and answers to the questions posed.

The rest of it, though, came across as little better than crude, occasionally violent, speculation centred around his relationship with the celebrated, and much feared, attorney Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong) whose thinly disguised homosexuality proves to be a more telling indictment of a New York that was beginning to come to terms with AIDS. Trump's rise from wealth to greater wealth and prosperity is skirted over too superficially with little meat put on the bones of his property acquisitions, developments and battles with an Ed Koch-led city hall, and it's all presented a bit too episodically weakly. Maria Bakalova acquits herself well enough as Ivana but as to the drama concerning the rest of his family, that's undercooked and I struggled to identify the accent(s) that seemed to be coming from his mother (Catherine McNally) as the importance of that torrid family unit struggles to impact on the story.

However, I changed my mind after hearing about the recently announced Oscar nominations bestowing accolades on Sebastian Stan for lead actor and Jeremy Strong for supporting actor for their performances in this picture. And it was through that viewing experience that I realized I should not have let my politics get in the way of my screening decisions.

This “origin story” about the meteoric rise of New York real estate mogul Donald Trump (Stan) in the 1970s and 80s candidly illustrates how he became the individual he is today under the tutelage of lawyer Roy Cohn (Strong), the infamous, underhanded political fixer who rose to prominence as Sen. Joseph McCarthy’s “trusted” associate during the 1950s Congressional anti-Communist hearings. Cohn, a man who would stop at virtually nothing to get his way for himself and his clients, groomed his impressionable apprentice on how to do the same for himself in business and in life, developments chronicled here in unreserved detail. In that sense, then, one could probably best characterize this offering as “instructive” about the nature of the man who went on to be elected to a second term as President, despite his many obvious and highly public failings. This story is brought to life thanks to the superb (and largely overlooked) screenwriting of Gabriel Sherman in only his second feature film outing, along with the picture’s fine editing, spot-on period piece production design, and outstanding performances of its two principals, particularly Strong. While the film indeed presents an excellent depiction of Trump’s apprenticeship in the business world, it could have been stronger when examining his personal life, particularly his stormy courtship of and arm’s-length marriage to wife Ivana (Maria Bakalova) and his rocky relationship with his family, both of which could have used some bolstering. Nevertheless, “The Apprentice” genuinely is one of the year’s best releases. It’s just a shame that more viewers didn’t see it before the last election.",8.0
1082195,The Order,"I reckon it's quite a testament to the confidence of Nicholas Hoult that he's prepared to take on a role quite this odious. He's ""Bob"", an intelligent white supremacist who has splintered from an arian church scenario and allied with a few like-minded people. The arrival of ""Husk"" (Jude Law) to the area's long abandoned FBI office might put a fly in his ointment, though, as he befriends enthusiastic cop ""Jamie"" (Tye Sheridan) and both try to get to the bottom of the increasingly audacious crimes being carried out in the name of reclaiming the beautiful and unspoilt land of Idaho, and even the broader USA itself, from it's impure interlopers. It's a little slow off the mark, but once we have the battle lines set out and realise that both of these men are capable of playing cat and mouse ruthlessly, the drama gathers a pace that's well held together by the two protagonists. It shines quite a forceful light on the dangers of jingoism and also quite interestingly tries to present us with some modicum of the rationales behind what drives this innate hatred, or at least tolerates it. With an increasing degree of zealousness appearing once again in Europe, this serves as quite a well written and characterful lesson in just how easily traction can be found when fear and loathing are peddled together with ignorance or religion or, most toxically, both. I could have been doing without the agent's familial backstory. It seems we just can't hit the ground running with the story in hand without having to trawl through his past, his traumas and his excessive drinking habits; but I don't suppose that interfered too much as we headed to a denouement that's historical fact, and quite potently presented.",7.0
1082195,The Order,"I found ""The Order"" unsettling but perhaps not quite for the reasons you might think. 

First off, whilst a lot of license has been taken here the bones of this tale of Neo Nazi's attempting to replace the US government in the 1980's really did happen. The facts of the tale have however been misconstrued in a way that makes the core antagonists look worse than they really were. The question then becomes, why? Its not as if they were especially nice people to start with, right? 

In my opinion, its hard not to see a thread of contemporary politicking in this film. In essence the underlying message appears to be the US government are promoters of peace and stability, whilst anyone opposing them is a violent merchant of chaos. Its a simplistic perspective that ignores the real need for change in the USA. A nation that has made political corruption and destructive war, its core business. Moreover, its governmental system has a nasty habit of going after even peaceful, non radical reformers, as well as racist violent ones.

Putting this consideration aside, how does this stack up as a film? Well, I'm seeing Jude Law in a new light. I'd never taken much notice of him in the past but he hands in a top notch performance in the role of an obsessive FBI agent, with a troubled personal life. Indeed, broadly speaking, acting in this film is excellent and it breathes life into the wholly believable characters.

The story flows well too, starting off slowly and gradually picking up pace. I'm not especially a fan of ""terrorists under the bed"", style films so for me to say I enjoyed this, for the most part and found it thoughtful is quite the compliment. 

In summary, excellent acting and a strong script bring this tale of violent political extremists, to life. That said, its worth remembering that not all political reform is bigoted and violent. In fact, sometimes its very much needed. As is the case in the USA and elsewhere in the West, today",7.0

""Jackpot! is a movie that delivers on its promise: pure, dumb entertainment. Without any pretensions of becoming a memorable film or delving into complex themes, Paul Feig delivers a light, admittedly silly experience, with a charismatic cast that stands out for its comedic delivery.

1029281,Strange Darling,"Ending my day with one last movie, I stumbled upon a film titled ""Strange Darling."" A psychological thriller revolving around a mass serial killer, I had no prior knowledge of its storyline. Without watching a trailer or reading a description, I decided to dive right in.

As the movie unfolded, I found myself completely absorbed in its narrative. The plot kept me on my toes, constantly questioning the identity of the serial killer. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, I was either right on the money or completely off track. The film demanded my full attention to catch the subtle clues and details.

While I found ""Strange Darling"" to be a decent watch and appreciated it for what it was, I don't think I would revisit it. The movie delved into gruesome and heavily exploited sexual themes, making it unsuitable for younger audiences. However, I could see why critics and viewers were praising it - the film's psychological thrills and twisted tale of a serial killer kept me guessing until the very end. Though I initially guessed wrong, once the pieces fell into place, the entire story made perfect sense.",8.0
1029281,Strange Darling,"A woman runs across a field, blood gushing from her ear. She's being chased by a man with an high powered rifle. Can she escape? Well across the next ninety minutes, and via six chapters and an epilogue, we are told the story of just how we got here. Except, the episodes are not shown to us in numerical order and this isn't the end. It's not really the beginning of the end, but maybe the end of the beginning? Willa Fitzgerald looks terrified, Kyle Gallner looks menacing - but as this cat and mouse game progresses our expectations of the narrative are well and truly challenged, and that proves especially perilous for just about everyone that either of these two characters meet as plenty of uses for handcuffs are demonstrated - none of which were probably as advertised on the box! It doesn't actually take you too long to figure out what is happening, especially as the opening slide reveals it's historical source and so does impact on the jeopardy a little. That said, though, there's a gently seedy eroticism running through this drama and there's also quite an entertaining chemistry between the two characters that, like quite a lot of this film, invites us to reconsider established sexual stereotyping. It's violent at times, bloody too - but in the vein of Hammer rather than Tarantino and it's tongue is in it's cheek for a fair chunk as it evolves. If you get a chance to see in the cinema, the give it a go - it almost certainly won't pan out as you'd expect. (All shot on 35mm, apparently, but I'm not too sure I noticed!)",7.0
1029281,Strange Darling,"Visually, <em>'Strange Darling'</em> is a treat.

It's an extremely stylish movie, the film features some excellent shots as well as great music. I'm not fully sold on the base story, I feel like if you stripped every other element back then you'd be left with a real mid plot. On the other hand, though, when all is said and done I think I did get a good amount of entertainment from it.

I don't believe it needed to be told in nonlinear order, you could've portrayed events more traditionally and I don't think it wouldn't changed much (if anything) in terms of the viewing experience. With that said, it is easy to keep up with the jumps and it doesn't hinder the flick whatsoever. So, I guess, if it works, why not?

The performances of Willa Fitzgerald and Kyle Gallner are excellent, to be fair. They both fit their respective roles and each play their part in keeping the movie marching along nicely. The support cast merit relative praise as well, notable to see Ed Begley Jr. and Steven Michael Quezada involved - a <em>'Better Call Saul'</em> reunion, of sorts.

The film's use of non-linear chapter framing was intriguing and innovative, showcasing Mollner's talent for delivering the emotional depth of each scene. He adeptly balanced the timeline with the message each chapter conveyed. However, the plot lacked direction at times, diverging into unintended paths, which slightly hindered the overall narrative. Giovanni Ribisi's cinematography was nothing short of phenomenal, capturing each moment with precision and artistry. The lead actors, Willa Fitzgerald as ""The Lady"" and Kyle Gallner as ""The Demon,"" delivered outstanding performances that truly brought their characters to life.

""Boy Kills World finds its stage when it focuses on the cool stunts and explosion of unrestrained action that will certainly win over genre aficionados.

The revenge premise never quite flies off narratively, remaining a thematically superficial, undeveloped story, but the numerous sequences of violently choreographed fights are entertaining enough to please the majority of the audience. The layer of humor fits the light tone, but beware of the complete uninhibitedness regarding the doses of blood, ruthlessness, and creative use of everyday items for combat.

882059,Boy Kills World,"There's a bit of the television series ""Kung Fu"" (no panda) to the start of this film as we see a young deaf/mute boy being intensively trained by a mysterious and highly-skilled shaman deep in the jungle. Why? Well it turns out that civilisation is being governed by the dastardly, seriously hammy, ""Van Der Koy"" family and that every year they round up their enemies and kill them all on live TV. Remind you of anything? Our nameless, muscle-bound, hero (Bill Skarsgård) has an axe to grind with them, and egged on by his mentor sets about wreaking revenge on them for killing his family. Sadly, there's nothing at all original throughout the rest of this pretty dull action thriller that relies too heavily on a slightly comedic narration (his thoughts) guiding us through some set-piece and repetitious combat scenes that after about fifteen minutes left us in no doubt as to the conclusion we were headed for. The more heavily armed soldiers you have guarding something, the easier it is for one man to... The arrival of Michelle Dockery and the sparingly used Famke Janssen add nothing at all, indeed the former is actually pretty terrible and doesn't become any more menacing just because she takes on a mid-Atlantic drawl. It's a fight/stunt co-ordinators' wet dream this film, but for the rest if us it's ""Hunger Games"" light. Very light.",6.0
882059,Boy Kills World,"Boy Kills World is a mash up of by now well known martial arts action genres. 

Perhaps the most obvious nod is to films like ""Kill Bill"" which in turn is a satirical parody, of cheesy 70's, 80's and 90's, martial arts action films. 

Boy Kills World is superficially quite watchable but it feels truncated. This is especially evident in terms of character development and grim comedy. 

Had it delved further into its potential for larger than life, well rounded characterisations and better exploited its rather dark humour, it could have become a bit of a cult hit. 

By contrast, its, at times, gratuitous violence, like the creative but painfully cringe worthy, cheese grater scene, is something, I personally felt, needed to be dialled down. 

In summary, a watchable martial arts action mash up with a cheesy nod to older films, in the genre. Let down a little by missed opportunities for character development and dark humour. Not to mention, at times, over the top violence.",6.0

1022690,Ricky Stanicky,"This movie features a cast of actors I generally enjoy watching, but it turned out to be a mess. The only standout performance came from John Cena, who fully committed to his character and brought some much-needed energy to the film.

The main characters are depicted as despicable human beings, treating everyone around them poorly. The film tries to justify the protagonist's behavior by revealing an abusive background late in the story. This revelation feels like a cheap excuse to garner sympathy and forgive his dishonesty and mistreatment of others. For instance, there is no prior indication of the protagonist's abusive past until it becomes convenient for the plot, making it feel forced and insincere.

The attempt to use child abuse as a justification for the protagonist's actions is poorly handled and comes off as classless. The film fails to provide a nuanced portrayal of how an abusive background might realistically affect someone's behavior. Instead, it uses the abuse as a plot device to excuse the protagonist's otherwise inexcusable actions. 

John Cena's performance is the movie's saving grace. He brings a level of commitment and charisma to his role that is noticeably absent in the rest of the cast. Cena's dedication to his character provides some genuine moments of entertainment in an otherwise disappointing film. 

The story and writing are weak, failing to create a cohesive and engaging narrative. The characters' actions often lack logical motivation, and the plot feels disjointed. The writers seem to believe that mentioning a character's traumatic past is enough to generate empathy, but without proper buildup and context, this tactic falls flat. The worst part is that it is astoundingly unfunny.

This film is a disappointment despite its talented cast. The poorly executed story, unlikable characters, and insincere attempts at emotional depth make it a difficult watch. John Cena's performance is a rare bright spot, but it isn't enough to save the film from its fundamental flaws. For a more successful movie, the writers would need to focus on creating believable character arcs and a more coherent narrative. As it stands, the film fails to deliver on its potential and leaves much to be desired.",1.0
1022690,Ricky Stanicky,"“Ricky Stanicky” is a prime example of wasted potential, featuring stupid writing, unrealistic characters, and a barrage of unfunny jokes that fall flat. Directed by Peter Farrelly, this film squanders its promising premise and talented cast on a juvenile and uninspired, off-color comedy that fails to deliver enough laughs or entertainment to justify its sad existence. This is a really, really bad movie.

Twenty years after Dean (Zac Efron), JT (Andrew Santino), and Wes (Jermaine Fowler), three childhood best friends, created an imaginary scapegoat for their pranks and shenanigans, they still find themselves using the nonexistent Ricky Stanicky as an alibi for their immature behavior. After JT misses the birth of his first child due to yet another tall tale, their families get suspicious and demand to meet Mr. Stanicky. Panicked, the guys hired “Rock Hard” Rod (John Cena), a raunchy, washed-up celebrity impersonator from Atlantic City to bring their imaginary buddy to life. Rod takes his role far too seriously, which causes a lot of shenanigans to ensue, making the best friends wish they’d never created Ricky in the first place.

It sounds like a slam dunk of a premise that would lend itself to comedy gold, but Farrelly totally blows everything about his film. While it works as a childhood prank, it feels utterly ridiculous and implausible when applied to adult characters with families and responsibilities. These are grown men, for crying out loud.

Even worse, the film’s attempts at humor largely miss the mark, with most jokes and gags landing as total duds. Whether it’s the tired trope of bawdy rewrites of classic songs or the contrived scenarios involving Ricky Stanicky’s outrageous heroics, the comedy falls flat at every turn. Even the presence of a talented and charming cast can’t salvage the abysmal writing and lackluster execution.

839033,The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,"When the King decides to decline an offer for a strategic betrothal for his daughter ""Héra"", a duel ensues that sees the would-be suitor ""Wulf"" swear vengeance on the house of ""Helm Hammerhand"" and the kingdom of ""Rohan"" before he flees to the mountains. Before too long, he has made his presence felt amongst the usually warring hill tribes and is soon a force to be reckoned with by the King. With his capital being attacked, ""Helm"" must lead from the front - but can he trust all of his nobles? It turns out that his daughter and this rebel were childhood friends but it's not just him she doesn't want to marry, she has far more independent designs for her life that don't include marriage at all, and these are actively encouraged by her handmaiden - herself a woman to be reckoned with. With duplicity and tragedy all around her, she must lead her people to the safety of the ""Hornberg"" to avoid the harshness of both her enemy and the brutal winter, but can they survive the ordeal that awaits them. This is a perfectly watchable animated fantasy adventure with the odd snippet of Howard Shore's original ""Lord of the Rings - Two Towers"" (2002) score to pep it up, but the standard of the animation is really quite underwhelming. It's all very two-dimensional and it seemed to me that virtually no effort has been made to synchronise the lips and the voices. The story is adequate enough, but stretched really quite thinly as it tops the two hour mark without anywhere near enough going on. There's isn't so much a war as a siege, and after about half an hour it felt more like this was an introduction to a character who is going to - whether JRR Tolkien likes it or not - deliver some more Middle Earth adventures for sequels galore. It really underplays the characterful mythology of the topic and takes a very disappointingly ""Janet and John"" approach to the mysteries and evils of that realm which was so well captured twenty-odd years ago by Peter Jackson.",6.0
987686,A Family Affair,"Director Rich Peppiatt‘s rowdy, frenzied film “Kneecap” is a lively biopic based on the hell-raising Irish rap trio of the same name. You’ve probably never heard of these musicians, but the film celebrates the general sense of anarchy as these young men become key figures in a civil rights movement to save their mother tongue. It’s a story about finding your voice in a world that seems determined to keep you down, all told with a slew of swear words, hip-hop tracks, and lots of drug-fueled shenanigans.

Set in West Belfast in 2019, the film depicts the origins of the group Kneecap, including insight on how they created their unique sound. In a bid to push back against the establishment, Liam Óg, Naoise Ó Cairealláin, and JJ Ó Dochartaigh (who play themselves in the film) take to the stage as a symbol of Ireland’s restless youth. They refer to themselves as “low life scum,” and their message resonates with so many. By writing and performing hip-hop songs in Irish, they become a local sensation. This garners the attention of their political martyr father (Michael Fassbender), the ire of party conservatives, and the adoration of the people.

It’s a true story that doesn’t give a ton of insight into the band members, but it’s still a lot of fun. The film features plenty of original music by the trio (which admittedly is an acquired taste), and their politically-charged rhymes and defense of their cultural heritage speak volumes. The guys write what they know, and the truth resonates with locals. It comes down to this: when cops don’t want people hearing your music, that’s when you know you’re doing something right.

The songs and the film rapidly switch between English and Irish, so it takes a lot of concentration to watch. I could see some viewers quickly giving up, but those who stick it out will be rewarded.

Liam, JJ, and Naoise are rambunctious lot, and their shenanigans are sometimes questionable but always entertaining. There are quirky bursts of humor that make the boisterous characters even more appealing. None of these guys are great actors, but it adds to the unpolished authenticity of the film.

There’s a defiant energy to “Kneecap” that is invigorating, and the story is one that’s different and original.

987686,A Family Affair,"""A Family Affair,"" a recent Netflix release starring Nicole Kidman, Zac Efron, Kathy Bates, and that actress from ""Kissing Booth"" whose name escapes me, is a film that could easily fall into the realm of cheesy and corny. Surprisingly though, it manages to be one of those guilty pleasure movies that you can't help but enjoy.

While it's not groundbreaking by any means, the movie is surprisingly captivating and entertaining. The story revolves around a lonely celebrity who finds love in an unexpected place, his own assistant's mother. Yes, it's a bit cliché with Zac Efron and Nicole Kidman's characters falling for each other, but there are enough twists and surprises to keep things interesting.

There are moments that are cringe-worthy, moments that are heartwarming, and moments that are just plain cheesy. But overall, the film manages to strike a balance that makes it worth watching. It may not be a masterpiece, and it's unlikely to become a favorite that you'll revisit often, but if you're looking for something to pass the time, ""Family Love"" is worth a watch. It's not as bad as some may think, especially if you're a fan of romantic movies.",5.0
799766,Better Man,"There's something about the use of the monkey to characterise Robbie Williams that makes this quite a visceral watch at times. The film tells the story of the fairly turbulent rise of this ""Take That"" singer from boyhood exponent of Gilbert and Sullivan to a man on the right end of an £80 millions record deal. His dad (Steve Pemberton) went off to a football match whilst he was a child and never came back, and that left him with his mum ""Janet"" (Kate Mulvany) and adoring nan (Alison Steadman) living a pretty much hand to mouth existence and leaving him with a pretty solid foundation for his later emotional and trust issues. Unless you've lived on the moon these last twenty years, then you'll know much of what happens next. What does make this stand out a little more is the fact that Williams himself is behind the project and is in no way afraid to portray himself as a complete ass. His drink, drugs, tantrums and generally spoilt brattishness are laid bare with little, if any, attempt to sanitise. In some ways it reminded me of the recent ""Amy"" biopic and came hot on the heels of a recent viewing of ""Easter Parade"" (1948) with both serving, for completely different reasons, to augment the thrust of this story of a person who attained great stardom, success and wealth - and ultimately ended up with addictions galore and few, real, friends amidst a sea of hangers-on and parasites all too eager to selfishly cash in on the fame of a lad who started aged just fifteen. Of course it's not exactly balanced, and I'm sure the gospel according to Robbie might not be quite how others see their own behaviour (or his) but there is an honesty to this that brings home just how ruthless the music business is and at just how fickle fame can be when those we idolise lose their lustre. It doesn't do it any harm that many of his solo songs work well through big screen audio with some classy string arrangements and powerful vocals to remind us that, unlike many of the largely forgotten ""Take That"" singles, his music - especially the stuff he made with Guy Chambers - is the stuff we will really long remember. It's not for the faint hearted, but still well worth a watch.",7.0
1241320,キングダム 大将軍の帰還,"Kingdom 4: Return of The Great General continues the story from Kingdom 3, focusing less on Shin and more on General Ouki and his past, which is closely tied to Shin’s dream of becoming a great general. The film opens with a helpful recap and uses a clear narrative structure, including flashbacks, to introduce Houken, the main antagonist. Despite the less frequent large-scale battles, the intense duel between Ouki and Houken delivers powerful tension.

The conflict builds gradually as strategic decisions lead Qin’s forces into a trap, culminating in the climactic battle between the two generals. The film’s resolution is emotionally impactful, especially scenes where Ouki encourages Shin to see things from a general’s perspective, symbolizing Shin’s future role as Ouki’s successor. These heartfelt moments, combined with a strong closing message to Eisei and Shin’s rallying of the troops, create a perfect ending—though a fifth sequel is planned for 2026.

Performances are strong, with Takao Osawa standing out through expressive acting and convincing fight scenes. The cinematography, sound effects, and music effectively enhance the mood, from tension to sorrow and inspiration. Minor editing flaws, such as some artificial backgrounds, do not detract from the overall experience, making this the most emotionally resonant installment so far and a must-watch for fans.

673593,Mean Girls,"There are flashes of wit here, and a decent sound-track but for the most part it's a complete non-story. ""Cady"" (Angourie Rice) arrives as the newbie at the North Shore High School where she is shunned by all but the gay/rebellious combo that is ""Damian"" (Jaquel Spivey) and ""Janis"" (Auli'i Caravalho). For a bit of mischief, they decide that ""Cady"" should infiltrate the trio known as the ""Plastics"" - dominated by ""Regina"" (Reneé Rapp) whose leather clad frame has the whole school under her spell. She manages to ingratiate herself with this group of pretty vacuous airheads and report back to her ""real"" friends each day as the story gets thinner and thinner until it's needs the mother of all toupés. It's about bitchiness, friendship, duplicity, shallowness and then there's the floppy-haired eye candy ""Aaron"" (Christopher Briney) whom she and ""Regina"" squabble over - whilst he has all the loyalty of a goldfish; but none of it is really very original or funny. Writer Tina Fey appears as the calculus teacher but fails to impact much as the thing just meanders along ticking every box and beating just about every stereotype to death before the anthesis of all things obnoxious - a spring ""prom"" - brings things to an inevitable conclusion. Rapp can sing, and she knows how to take this stage-suited concept and belt out a song or two, but the rest of this really does remind me of one of the latter editions of the tired ""Glee"" project.

Angourie Rice is a bit meh in the lead role, certainly a downgrade on Lindsay Lohan. I guess most of the cast are inferior comparatively, but I did enjoy the performances of Reneé Rapp and Jaquel Spivey... Auliʻi Cravalho too.

673593,Mean Girls,"#MovieReview #MeanGirlsMusical #MeanGirls2024

Having never seen the original film before watching this new adaptation, I approached it with an open mind and fresh perspective. As such, I won't be comparing it to the earlier version.

Firstly, the cameo appearance from an original cast member was a nice touch, though it didn't elicit the same level of excitement for me as it might for die-hard fans. Now, onto the movie itself.

""Mean Girls 2024"" is a hit-or-miss experience, depending on your perspective. Dedicated fans of the franchise will likely appreciate it for what it is. As someone who enjoys musicals and appreciates a variety of music genres, I found the film to be enjoyable.

Reneé Rapp's portrayal of Regina George showcases her stage background, but she eventually settles into the role as the movie progresses. Although her casting may initially seem odd due to her towering height, she brings energy to the character. Her catchy solo song stands out, showcasing her vocal talent.

The dynamics between characters, particularly Regina and Cady, felt a bit off to me, given their stark height difference. However, both actresses deliver strong vocal performances. The portrayal of Gretchen and Karen also adds to the mix of characters, each bringing their unique quirks to the screen.

The movie delves into LGBTQ+, transgender, and sexual themes, though without nudity, making it a film geared towards a younger audience. While these themes didn't bother me personally, they are prevalent throughout the movie.

Though I wasn't a fan of the casting choice for Damien, finding him too eccentric, I appreciated the performances of the main characters. The male lead, though not heavily featured, serves his purpose in the storyline.

Overall, I would consider watching ""Mean Girls 2024"" again, but perhaps not in theaters. I'm uncertain if I would allow my son to watch it due to the mature subject matter.

1064486,Memoir of a Snail,"It feels great to laugh straight after you’ve just welled up. 

The characters in Memoir of a Snail, the new animated tale from Academy Award winner Adam Elliot, feel authentically real to us - and even though Elliot includes jokes, he doesn’t joke ABOUT them. 

He lays them bare to us with respect, and imbues his odd menagerie with… well, with dignity. Which is a funny thing to say about something with plasticine eyeballs and glycerine tears.

1064486,Memoir of a Snail,"Australian animator and filmmaker Adam Elliot’s last full-length feature film was Mary and Max (2009). Memoir of a Snail is narrated and told from the point of view of Grace Pudel (Sarah Snook). Grace details her life story that finds humor and sentimentality in the face of depression, shortcomings, and letdowns.

There are two people in the world that Grace feels comfortable with: her twin brother Gilbert (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and her best friend Pinky (Jacki Weaver). Their mother died during childbirth and their father is a drunk paraplegic who is a former street performer and animator from France. Grace developed the desire to be an animator while Gilbert wants to be a street performer.

After their father passes away, the twins are separated and put into foster homes in two separate states. They spend the majority of the film writing letters to one another and dreaming of the day that they can reunite.

As an adult, Grace meets Pinky. Pinky wears giant, red-rim glasses, is covered in wrinkles and liver spots, and habitually smokes cigars. She has traveled all over the world, met countless people, been with only a handful of memorable men, and has lived a crazy life full of no regrets or dull moments. She quickly becomes Grace’s best friend.

Grace becomes obsessed with snails at a young age. She keeps live ones as pets in a jar and buys every snail-related knickknack she can get her hands on. She also likes to read trashy romance novels and is constantly eating Chiko Rolls, which are spring rolls that are the size of burritos.

If you haven’t seen Mary and Max or his 2003 Academy Award-winning short Harvie Krumpet, Adam Elliot’s stop-motion animated style isn’t as smooth and polished as recent Laika or Aardman films have become. Elliot’s stop-motion still looks like it was hand-crafted by humans – visible balls of clay that have been molded into these soul-driven characters that we eventually grow to love.

It would have been extremely easy for Adam Elliot to make Memoir of a Snail into a film that emotionally destroys the audience and never looks back. However, the film is written in a way that makes you feel an entire spectrum of emotions over a mere 90 minutes.

Anyone who grew up as a loner will sympathize with Grace, especially when devoting your life to collecting something you love. But her story is presented in a way that allows you to laugh at all the terrible things in her life. The characters in the film, no matter how much screen time they’re given, are loaded with eccentricities.

There’s a bum who lost his job as a court judge because he liked to masturbate in court, the foster family Gilbert is sent to is a wildly religious one complete with gibberish prayers and apple worshipping, and Grace falls in love with a man in the neighborhood while he’s using his leaf blower.

Surprisingly, Memoir of a Snail is R-rated. There’s some mild vulgarity in there and repeated use of the middle finger, but there’s also a shocking amount of nudity. Grace’s foster family has this boring front of designing traffic lights. They create awards for her every week and hang them on her wall to get her to stop being sad about being separated from her brother. But they’re also swingers who like to take exotic vacations purely driven based on having sex with new people in a new place.

Memoir of a Snail is an animated film that is as enjoyable on an emotional level as a thought-provoking one. The film has several life lessons that stick with you afterward. Grace, Gilbert, and their father all wrestle with feeling caged in throughout the film, but the difference is who feels like a glass half full, a glass half empty, and just a glass.

Made on a rapid 32-week shooting schedule where animators had to complete 10 seconds a day to finish on time, Memoir of a Snail is a small-budget animated film that feels like a handmade labor of love. 

It’s a film that honors weird people no matter how bizarre they may be. Next to its superb writing and ability to make you laugh while ripping your heartstrings to shreds, that is what makes it so beautiful and memorable.",9.0
1064486,Memoir of a Snail,"When an elderly lady gives out her last breath, and yells something about potatoes, we realise that “Grace” is now on her own. She’s a middle aged woman wearing a knitted hat with two big eyes poking from stalks on the top. She’s what you might call a glass half empty sort of person, and as she releases her pet snail “Sylvia” from her jar into the vegetable garden she begins to regale us with the story of just how she, and her long-lost brother “Gilbert” grew up with their paraplegic dad; became orphaned, separated and then how she spent the rest of her life in increasing isolation making some rather unfortunate choices. Indeed, by an early age “Grace” is really only happy living in her room with her collection of gastropods. There’s a lovely melancholy to this story and the dialogue is riddled with typically Australian epithets, sarcasm and very dry wit as the tale of woes upon woes upon more woes is engagingly unfolded over the next ninety minutes, but it’s the astonishing detail of the animation that really stands out here. Right from the beginning, as we tour a home that looks more like an old curiosity shop we see not just great detail amongst the mechanics of the imagery, but there’s plenty of more subtle content hidden in plain sight for us to spot and frequently raise a smile at, too. There’s an enjoyably compelling attraction from her downbeat monologues as she lurches from bad news to more bad news and I thought it had shades of the Tim Burton too it as it edged towards it’s denouement. It’s really superbly crafted artistry this, and though it does put a smiley face on things, it also takes quite a poignant look at family and loneliness too. This is really a film for a big screen if you get the chance, some of the facial expressions are every bit as human as anything people can do for real!",7.0
1064486,Memoir of a Snail,"It’s been a long time since I’ve been moved by a piece of cinema as much as I was with “Memoir of a Snail,” a dark, profound, and highly personal stop-motion film from writer / director Adam Elliot . This work of animation confirms the power of the medium as a vessel for mature, deeply philosophical storytelling, and it’s just a beautiful film from start to finish.

Crafted with painstaking detail, the film is a bittersweet memoir of Grace Pudel (voice of Sarah Snook), a woman overcome with melancholy in 1970s Australia. When she was younger, Grace and her twin brother Gilbert (voice of Kodi Smit-McPhee) were separated and sent to grow up in starkly contrasting home environments. He was abused in a cruel Evangelical household while she found herself slowly withdrawing from the world. Isolated and sad, Grace’s life journey is one that’s filled with repeated heartbreak, but she still has a few passions in life (including romance novels, guinea pigs, and snails). This film tells her story.

The film exhibits the emotional resonance that animation can achieve when placed in the hands of a skilled storyteller. Intense and authentic, this is one for thoughtful adults rather than a throwaway for kids, especially since Elliot touches on themes of suffering, love, loss, and tragedy. This highly emotional film hit me, hard.

The gloomy visual style beautifully complements the gravity of the film’s themes. Each frame feels delicately and deliberately crafted like a piece of handmade art, capturing the melancholy of Grace’s life. It’s a world that’s bleak, yet also cozy when she’s within the confines of her small world.

The story continues to show Grace’s slow transformation through her unlikely friendship with the Pinky (voice of Jacki Weaver), an eccentric elderly woman. The pair share a healing bond that adds a bittersweet layer to a narrative that’s rich with tragedy and pain. There’s a lovely tenderness to the relationship between Pinky and Grace, which gives an authentic look at the importance of human connection in an increasingly harsh world.

Achingly beautiful and deeply profound, “Memoir of a Snail” is a very different type of animated film. Powerful and complex, this is nothing short of a masterwork in animated storytelling.

932420,Code 8 Part II,"The first Code 8 movie, was never going to be an award winner but at least it had an element of danger, pacing and excitement. 

Regrettably, its sequel, seems to be more a vehicle for woke tropes than  an actual sci fi film. It appears to be mostly about people from diverse backgrounds being either abused by ""the system"" or co-opted into it, as state sponsored abusers. 

The results feels like what it is. A moral statement viewed from a particular point of view, rather than an exciting, sci fi film, which is what, in this reviewers opinion, it should have been. 

Its slow paced, not terribly exciting and really goes nowhere interesting but then, how could it? 

In summary, I, for one, am sick and tired of having simple escapist entertainment hi-jacked to peddle a specific world view. That is what activism and social commentary are for. Of course, the irony too, is the harder this kind of thing is foisted on people, in my experience, the more they tend to reject it.",4.0

1109255,Parthenope,"Along the lines of the legendary beauty Aphrodite, “Parthenope” (Celeste Dalla Porta) was born in the sea and grew to become a great temptress to both of her male contemporaries. The first being her obsessed brother “Raimondo” (Daniele Rienzo) and the other her adoring childhood friend “Sandrino” (Dario Aita) whose unrequited love for her drove him to distraction. Not, however, to such distraction as that of her sibling, It’s when the trio decide to head for an unfunded trip from their home in Naples to the nearby island of Capri that she meets elderly American writer/dipso “Cheever” (Gary Oldman) who finds her intriguing but appears to have a certain immunity to her charms and she’s not used to that. Whilst on this carefree trip there befalls a tragic realisation that causes all of them to appreciate the stark realities and fickle shallowness of their lives and brings into focus senses of grief, rejection and emptiness. It’s a beautifully photographed piece of cinema, this film, with sparing dialogue and a sexually, but not explicitly so, charged chemistry abundant throughout this rather visually extravagant but disappointingly soulless drama. It is a bit like a postcard upon which is a beautiful picture but just too few words to develop the characters or to quite put enough meat on their perfectly formed bones. Indeed as the second hour starts to drag, the whole thing begins to look more like a repetitively self-indulgent vanity exercise that might be rooted in mythology but that struggles to engage beyond the superficial. It’s classy and stylish and well worth a look - but look appears to be all Paolo Sorrentino wants us to do.",6.0
998846,Back to Black,"Truth, if it were needed, that Lesley Manville can turn her hand to anything, but otherwise this is a rather unremarkable biopic of a woman whose character, I must confess, I didn't actually like very much. She is the nan of Amy (Marisa Abela) and the two have a special bond. Amy lives with her mum who is divorced from her dad Mitch (Eddie Marsan). He fancies himself as a bit of a crooner and she is steeped in jazz, determined to write her own songs and make a success of herself - on her own terms. Enter Nick (Sam Buchanan) who works for music mogul Simon Fuller and she is, after an initial bit of hostility, signed up and on her way. The remainder of the chronology is all pretty straightforward as Sam Taylor-Johnson decides to focus on an entirely speculative look at how her personal life developed. Amy's increasingly strained relationship with her friends and her father, her grandmother's terminal illness and her ""toxic co-dependent"" relationship with the charismatic Blake (Jack O'Connell). There's no doubting that many of her songs are great - even if the role of Mark Ronson in any of that is largely ignored, and hats off to Abela for putting her own slant on them. She does her own singing and though she does rather over-egg it, she does imbue a sense of the sheer force of personality this woman had. O'Connell, too, does well enough - especially with his Shangri-La dance in the pub when they meet, but somehow the whole narrative is just too bitty and episodic. The presentation of her character is way too shallow and frankly she is portrayed as a bit of an obnoxious brat. Her increasing exposure to the hounding paparazzi is well illustrated and that growing sense of exasperation obvious, but again we jump around too much as we seem to be rushing to a conclusion we know all about. At two hours it is too long in many ways and too short in others. The dialogue offers us little insight into just who she was and by the end, I felt sad for her but can't say I really cared about any of them. The aggression of the photographers seems to receive a disproportionate share of the blame for her predicament whilst rather discounting her own series of bad choices fuelled by her own immaturity and by the public's obsessions with watching what it builds up come crashing down. They couldn't sell their photos if we didn't want to buy them. A memorable musical legacy left behind by one who, along with so many other ground-breaking but flawed musical geniuses, might just have been better left for our ears.",6.0
998846,Back to Black,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://movieswetextedabout.com/back-to-black-movie-review-a-shallow-and-insulting-portrayal-of-amy-winehouse/

""Back to Black completely fails in adapting Amy Winehouse’s life to the big screen, falling into common biopic traps, and drowning in them. The film not only disrespectfully omits and revises critical facts from the artist’s life but also fails to convey the emotional depth of her music and the challenges she faced.

By turning her story into a superficial, cheap version, not even Marisa Abela’s remarkable performance can save the horrendous work of Sam Taylor-Johnson and Matt Greenhalgh.

It deserves no recommendation, serving only as an example of what to avoid when adapting the life of a real person to cinema.""

Rating: D-",2.0
998846,Back to Black,"<em>'Back to Black'</em> is not the best.

The opening chunk of the movie, say the first 30-45 minutes, is not good, a very rocky beginning. The introduction to the characters felt unnatural, the spontaneous moments of the lead character (who they make a tiny bit unlikeable at around that point) singing... borderline cringe. I will say, though, from after that the film does improve, funnily enough once the titular track plays I enjoyed this more.

Now for the cast. Marisa Abela is, acting-wise, decent enough, I'm not sold on her likeness to Amy Winehouse but I only really know of the musician minimally in her later years so I could very likely be wrong to question it to be fair. Her accent forced as well, though that could be a similar case as to what I just mentioned with the resemblance.

I did feel like I was watching Abela acting like Winehouse, rather than Winehouse portrayed by Abela. What I mean by that is in the best biopics I feel like I'm watching the person depicted, almost documentary-esque, but here it felt more obvious that I was watching someone act as someone, if that makes sense. Same can be said for Jack O'Connell, I know zero about Blake Fielder-Civil but still felt like O'Connell was overtly imitating someone.

There are positives, though. Lesley Manville puts in a good performance, her scenes with Abela are the film at its strongest. Eddie Marsan is solid too. It also does what's needed to make you care for the main character, even if that isn't all that difficult. Winehouse's big songs, at least all the ones I know of, are featured well; I most liked 'Valerie' years back, but that eponymous track really is outstanding.

No doubt super sad how Winehouse's life played out, I knew she died fairly young but when the epilogue details that she passed at just 27 it really does hit hard... such a waste. As for this movie in itself, mind, it's not all that unfortunately.",6.0
1125311,Imaginary,"Anyone remember an half-naked Tom Payne getting pulled into a barrel of hookers by Stellan Skarsgård in ""the Physician"" (2013)? That vision might just have forgiven this film had he featured a bit more, but clearly he had read the derivative script and decided it only merited one filming day - hence he hardly features at all. What does feature is the usual dysfunctional family malarkey with him newly married to the well-meaning animator ""Jessica"" (DeWanda Wise) who is trying to stay on friendly terms with his two daughters - the teenage ""Taylor"" (Taegen Burns) and the younger ""Alice"" (Pyper Braun). The family decide to move into her father's house - he is now in a care home - and quickly the youngest discovers a bear. Yep - a teddy bear. What can go wrong? Well it isn't a very nice bear, indeed it's distinctly malevolent and is soon trying to lure all of them (except Tom who has fled the proceedings by now) into a parallel reality with lots of rooms containing lots of scenarios. Some benign, so less so. Poor old ""Jess"" is soon at her wits end but fortunately neighbour ""Gloria"" (Betty Buckley) is on hand with some pearls of wisdom that might help them through this rapidly menacing quagmire! Or will they? This film plays out exactly as you would expect. There isn't an original bone in it's body, the acting is mediocre at best - but wait, it's nowhere near as banal as the extracts from the Janet & John book of horror film writing. Some of the dialogue here really does have you staring at the cinema ceiling in disbelief. It's another standard Blumhouse offering that passes the time without you having to engage your brain in the slightest - in fact, you could just watch the last ten minutes and miss very little from the rest of it.",5.0
1125311,Imaginary,"Pyper Braun merits praise, <em>'Imaginary'</em> otherwise falls flat.

I was never locked into the story and I didn't really care for the characters at any point, even Braun's Alice isn't all that interesting despite a rather great performance from the young actress. DeWanda Wise is a bit dull, while Tom Payne disappoints somewhat - I mean he only has a small role, sure, but his acting is unconvincing... and I know he can actor far better, as seen during his time on TV's <em>'<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)"" rel=""nofollow"">The Walking Dead</a>'</em>.

The antagonists in this are poorly utilized, the poster bear is prevalent but very boring. It needed a Chucky-esque portrayal, rather than the blank stare we get every few minutes. The ending also drags, I thought it was going to end sooner a few times but it kept finding new ways to stick around; nothing majorly grating, granted. The score is at least OK.

It also, amusingly, took me ages to work out what the bear's name was. I'm not familiar with the name ""Chauncey"", so genuinely for the longest time thought the name was either ""John C"" or ""Shaun C"". It was only when I finally noticed it written down visually that I realised! 😂

In conclusion, credit to Braun but everyone else onscreen and off it could've done better in my opinion.",5.0
1216191,Oddity,"I'm always on the lookout for good horror. Oddity is almost ""perfect"". This could easily be a 7 or 8. Instead it's a 6, or maybe a 5. The final act just didn't work for me. The big reveal is fine, but what happens after the big reveal makes little sense to me.

There's also a bit before the big reveal - let's call it the small reveal - where the logic just falls flat too, but I was willing to ignore it at the time. Unfortunately, it was a sign of things to come.

SPOILERS AHEAD!

The more I think about it, the less sense it makes. Darcy learned the full conversation from Olin posthumously. How the heck did she not learn anything from Dani's personal effects?

748230,Salem's Lot,"""Salem's Lot"" is a well paced and perfectly watchable film that often manages to strike out on its own with a considerable degree of success. However, it proves to be a different matter entirely when it tackles the more spooky scenes which had the hallucinatory quality of a fever dream and made the original such a compulsive and memorable viewing experience. It recreates each one of these scenes, but with considerably less effectiveness  (this is in large part due to the noticeable absence of Harry Sukman's superb music to magnify and intensify them) and as a direct consequence of this the scenes in question - Marjorie Glick on a mortician's table rising to join the undead, Mike Ryerson returning from the dead and so on - lack the necessary fear and tension in this latest incarnation which just confirms that Tobe Hooper's version of ""Salem's Lot"" (1979) is still the ultimate in terror.",5.0
748230,Salem's Lot,"Overstays its welcome and isn't as interesting as it could've been, but what's there is still serviceable.

I really enjoyed the cast, I think every member does a neat job - without that being the case, I'd probably be rating this film a touch lower. Lewis Pullman leads events well, while Makenzie Leigh, Alfre Woodard and Bill Camp are able supports. The kid actors are solid as well, the standout evidently being Jordan Preston Carter. Good to see Pilou Asbæk, too.

As noted at the top, this does overrun. It felt a fair bit longer than 113 minutes, a more fitting run time may have worked wonders. I did like how, aside from the obvious, no cast member had major plot armour, admittedly one of the young ones does seem a tad overpowered in regards to what he achieves throughout.

All in all, I'd consider <em>'Salem’s Lot'</em> a narrowly passable horror flick.",7.0
748230,Salem's Lot,"For anyone old enough to remember, Coles Notes offered students an accessible summary of famous works, by the likes of Dickens, Shakespeare or Tolstoy. 

Something similar can be said of the latest cinematic iteration of Stephen Kings book, Salem's Lot. This is an abridged version of Kings vampiric tale. It plays out in broad, somewhat hurried, expository strokes, absent the deeper essence of the work. Things happen quickly, at the expense of a slowly established atmosphere of creeping dread, as the viewer comes to see whats really going on, in the rural town, of Salem's Lot. Indeed, the core of what makes this tale so terrifying, is revealed in the opening scenes. 
In short, this is Salem's Lot for the impatient. 

Frankly, the first cinematic production of Salem's Lot, starring David Soul, remains, I believe, by far the best re-imagining of Kings work, to this day.  

In summary, the latest cinematic edition of Salem's Lot is not awful but it rushes through the story, largely spoiling the atmosphere of creeping terror, I believe, is at the bloody heart, of this nightmarish tale.",5.0
748230,Salem's Lot,"Celebrated author ""Ben"" (Lewis Pullman) returns to his childhood home looking to do some investigations into his own youth when he discovers that there's something distinctly unsavoury going on in the ""Lot"". That all seems to centre around the long abandoned ""Marsten"" house that’s basement has recently received a strange package before a local urchin goes missing. Luckily for our intrepid writer, he has hooked up with ""Susan"" (Makenzie Leigh), somewhat sceptical local doctor ""Cody"" (Alfre Woodard) and with the savvy young ""Mark"" (Jordan Preston Carter) and as it becomes pretty clear what's going on, they have to work out a strategy that will keep them all alive! This, sadly, hasn't an original bone in it's body - falling somewhere between mediocre Hammer and that ""Penny Dreadful"" television series we saw ten years ago. The acting is pretty woeful, but no worse than the overly descriptive dialogue and with the possible exception of the young Carter who at least puts some effort into the proceedings, the rest of this follows all too predictable lines before a denouement that offers us nothing new either. Sure, reinventing this particular wheel is nigh-on impossible, but then why make it? It's not as if it has any sense of menace or peril, there are no gruesome special effects or harrowing scenes of gore and blood-lust; it's more like a series of unfunny comedy sketches set in an eerie scenario where just turning on the light (or not going into the place in the first place) might have been a better solution. It's far too long and slow to get going, and all I can think of really is bring back David Soul. Standard television fayre for Halloween, no need to trek to the cinema for this.",5.0
1088514,La habitación de al lado,"Successful writer ""Ingrid"" (Julianne Moore) is signing some books when one of her friends informs her that old pal ""Martha"" (Tilda Swinton) is suffering from cancer. Upon visiting her in hospital, she discovers that things aren't looking so good and over the following days the two start to become closer, sharing confidences and becoming quite inter-reliant. When an experimental treatment fails to deliver, the former war reporter ""Martha"" makes quite a bold proposal to her friend that will require them to retreat to a quiet residence in Woodstock where she will take matters into her own hands. Initially quite wary of this plan, ""Ingrid"" must decide whether or not she wishes to help - with all the moral and legal ramifications that involves, and so she turns to both of these women's ex-boyfriend ""Damian"" (John Turturro) for advice as she wrestles with her conscience. The concept here is really quite poignant, especially in light of reinvigorated conversations here in the UK about the rights of the terminally ill to make their own choices without fear of those they leave behind being persecuted by either the law or the zealous but I can't say I loved the presentation or the style. Far too much of the dialogue between the two women seems more aimed at filling-in the audience rather than on building a rapport between them. Things that they would have to have known about the other are presented in all too sterile a fashion, and at times I wondered if there wasn't a fair degree of dubbing going on too. Indeed, the whole thing deals with some seriously emotional issues in a remarkably sterile fashion. Both actors deliver strongly, but their dynamic isn't convincing - well, it wasn't for me, and the surfeit of verbiage rather suffocated the emotional impact the film could have made. Alex Høgh Andersen sheds his Viking leathers to remind us briefly of the ghastliness of the Vietnam war but otherwise this is largely down to the two characters dealing with a scenario we all dread, just not terribly convincingly.",6.0
1088514,La habitación de al lado,"Bold as always, Spanish master Pedro Almodóvar elegantly tackles the touchiest of subjects for his first English-language feature. And it's a film that could change your mind about euthanasia.

_The Room Next Door_ peels back the very layered onion of the right-to-die movement with an emotional heartbeat that’s truly rewarding to watch. It’s strong, yet wonderfully nuanced; it features two sublime actresses at the very top of their game; and – dare we say it – this so-called tragic drama even has its laugh out loud moments. 

If this were another drama (or a Hollywood weepie), you might expect Ingrid to plead with Martha to reconsider. Instead, Almodóvar introduces far more interesting thought bubbles. When they begin to have minor disagreements, it feels like small scabs being picked off a much bigger wound. There’s a shadow living with them – an elephant in the room next door, lying in wait to land a crushing blow.

_The Room Next Door_’s final act is a thought-provoking look at the right to die, and the uneasy ways this moral argument grinds its cogs alongside the laws we’ve created. Technically, Ingrid commits a felony - but Almodóvar is asking, _did Ingrid do anything wrong?_

With its gentle quality, it’s hard not to take _The Room Next Door_ home with you. Yes, it’s a death-affirming story. And yet by probing the delicacy of our short lifespans – time spent writing about warfare, and painting, and breathing mountain air, and making love – it’s also a deeply life-affirming one.

1088514,La habitación de al lado,"To live or to die is a decision many of us are probably reluctant to address. The fear of this great unknown is enough to keep the notion at bay. But what if we were to find ourselves dealing with a terminal illness with little hope for the future? Would we be willing to nobly soldier on, knowing that our circumstances are only going to get worse, or would we choose to transition to what’s next on our own time and under our own terms? Such is the scenario involving two old friends, Martha (Tilda Swinton), a former war correspondent who has lived a rich, full life but is now afflicted with terminal cancer, and Ingrid (Julianne Moore), a successful author who recently penned a book detailing her personal fear of death. When Martha’s condition takes a turn for the worse and her joy of living rapidly begins vanishing, she decides she wants to pass on before she significantly deteriorates. She willfully chooses to die with dignity in a comfortable and beautiful setting of her choosing. But she doesn’t want to be alone when the time comes: She wants to be in the presence of a compassionate soul in those final moments, someone not to act as a facilitator but who can provide company, comfort and support “in the room next door” as she slips away. And so it’s indeed ironic when Martha asks Ingrid to be that person. It’s a proposal about which Ingrid has serious reservations, but she also recognizes that she can’t in all good conscience turn her back on a friend. These circumstances also provide her with an opportunity to face firsthand the fears she’s just written about. But, those well-intentioned considerations aside, how will matters unfold for all concerned when events are no longer theoretical and turn real? That’s what writer-director Pedro Almódovar explores in his latest feature offering, providing viewers with a thoughtful, profound yet practical and eminently moving take on a controversial subject, one that’s been surfacing more candidly and more frequently in public discourse than it once did and that carries myriad ramifications ethically, emotionally and legally. While the film periodically veers off onto somewhat unrelated narrative tangents and occasionally becomes a little too talky for its own good (qualities that often encroach upon Almódovar’s works), this is arguably one of the filmmaker’s finest efforts both in terms of the sensitivity employed in the treatment of its subject, as well as in raising questions about the validity and propriety of right to die matters. It’s particularly noteworthy for the superb performances of its two principals, both of whom turn in some of the best work of their careers, as evidenced by Swinton’s Golden Globe Award nomination for best lead actress in a drama. It’s long been believed that none of us will know the time when we’ll pass, that it’s something left up to fate. But must it be that way, especially if we deliberately put our minds to our circumstances? “The Room Next Door” gives us much to ponder in this regard, showing us how leaving matters to chance ultimately might not be the wisest or most fulfilling course for all of us to follow.",7.0

1139829,Orion and the Dark,"While I wouldn't say this animation is as good as other works of Charlie Kaufman, or anything exceptional (even when you consider that its audience is children) it certainly was a joy to watch this movie. And I also got to appreciate the dark a little bit more after watching it.",8.0
1139829,Orion and the Dark,"I recommend this movie for a fun and enjoyable watch, as it has a cute and engaging storyline. While the characters may not be very memorable, the film still offers a good time.

There are instances where the movie could benefit from less dialogue and more adventure, perhaps cutting down on certain cartoonish elements. This adjustment could enhance the overall experience and make it more captivating for the audience.

It's a great movie for kids to watch and have a good time with, although the characters may not leave a lasting impression. Dark, in particular, stands out as a potentially memorable character, while the lead character may fade from memory over time.

Despite its shortcomings, the movie is entertaining and worth watching, especially for a casual viewing session. While it may not be a film you'd revisit often, it can serve as a pleasant distraction or background entertainment during chores or other activities",5.0
1061699,The Six Triple Eight,"When it's brought to the attention of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt (Susan Sarandon) that the soldiers fighting in Europe aren't getting their morale-bolstering mail, she convinces her husband (Sam Waterston) that something has to be done about it. Meantime, a regiment of African American women is festering away at a fort awaiting, in vain, orders that will get them meaningfully employed. Well! Now they have a task, and under the command of their newly promoted Maj. Adams (Kerry Washington) are posted to Europe. They are unaware of the sale of their project until presented with half a dozen enormous hangars full to the brim of rotting envelopes, packages and their fair share of rats. Chief amongst the newly arrived soldiers is ""Lena"" (Ebony Obsidian) who joined up after her beau ""Abram"" (Gregg Sulkin) went off to war as a pilot and was reportedly killed in action. She, and her determined colleagues, are determined to make a difference and the remainder of this drama depicts their struggles against their own side rife with bigotry and sexism whilst the bombs are never far away and the task is quite literally Herculean - only they can't just divert a river to solve this one. It's a fact, so the conclusion isn't in doubt, and the story is quite an interesting one as it not only challenges stereotypical attitudes, but quite poignantly illustrates how downright counter-productive these were. The execution, though, is all rather bland. Washington is competent but nothing more, indeed that's true of almost all of the acting talent on display here - aside from a lively and earthy effort from Shanice Shantay as the the engagingly rough-around-the-edges Johnnie Mae; and the writing takes a sledge hammer to the racial undertones that, once it's made it's bleedin' obvious point, just proceeds to labour that a bit too heavily. It's fascinating to see glimpses of the ""intelligence"" these women used to repatriate the post with the person and at times it's quite funny too as their intuition and common sense proved astonishingly effective but that's all rather swept under the carpet as the story focusses too much on the soapy elements of their travails. Indeed the ending, and the significance of their achievement, is all just a bit too rushed. It's a film that might have made for a better documentary celebrating the dedication of these ladies. As a piece of cinema, it's at best an high-quality television movie and an over-long one at that.",6.0
932086,Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,"Well it's certainly a saga! Against a backdrop of the American Civil war we are introduced to half a dozen different spokes on the wheel of pioneering America that gradually head towards a centre of what I assume will be the creation of the fabric of modern day USA by the end of part four. It begins rather brutally when a woman shoots a man then flees the scene with her infant child. Despite her proximity to the victim he survives and orders his two sons to pursue her. Meantime, there's a wagon train heading across the Apache dominated territory under the command of ""Matthew"" (Owen Wilson) and, separately, ""Hayes"" (Kevin Costner) is doing a bit of wintery horse-trading. With the younger Apache restless and determined to do what they can to thwart the encroachment on their ancient hunting grounds, they attack another white-man's settlement decimating the population. It's only after some sterling riding from the young ""Russell"" (Etienne Kellici) to a nearby army post that we meet ""Lt. Gephart"" (Sam Worthington) and his sagely ""Sgt. Major Riordan"" (Michael Rooker) who arrive to pick up the pieces amidst the charred ruins. The survivors include the terrified ""Frances"" (Sienna Miller) and her daughter ""Lizzie"" (Georgie MacPhail) whom they rescue from a tunnel in which they were hiding. The two adults immediately click perhaps offering us a glimmer of romance for the remorseful widow? Across the country, ""Hayes"" arrives in a small settlement where he encounters the good-time girl ""Marigold"" (Abbey Lee) and her young baby who just happen to be the one the avenging sons are looking for. Needless to say he, and his Colt revolver, have to come to the rescue and they decide it's better to take to the hills to avoid yet more trouble. With the forbidding west outstretched before these characters and the dangers and demons of their pasts never far behind them, the adventure is teed up for part two. To be fair, this looks great with some stunning drone cinematography illustrating really well the the scope of this virgin land that is every bit as hostile at times as those who have lived there for generations. There's also some impressive battle scenes as the maturing natives try to protects their homeland. The style of the rest of the narrative is just all a bit too bitty, though. Costner doesn't really appear until hour two and the substantial elements of the plot draw heavily from a very well established genre that it was always going to be difficult to reinvent or reimagine. The score helps it along rousingly at times and dialogue is sparingly used by most of the characters which is also quite a sensible tactic as we quickly realise we are in for just as long a slog as the settlers. It's the necessary character establishment part of this story which we can only hope will pad out the people more and rely less on the visuals as the story progresses. Otherwise, it's not really much better than a series of episodes of ""Bonanza"" bolted together.",6.0
932086,Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,"<em>'Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 1'</em> surpassed my expectations!

A three-hour western, which is only the first of many connected entries? Yeah, that doesn't exactly set the pulses racing! Based on that, I was anticipating it to be a slow-moving set-up to future chapters. However, to my surprise this opening installment is a lot of fun. For a film of such a length, it absolutely flies by; this felt like a 2hr, max, movie to me.

My main praise for this film is directed at the pacing (evidently), the visuals and the score - the latter is particularly outstanding. I will say there are a fair few scenes that I felt could've been lit better, mainly across the opening chunk - not a big deal, though.

There are so many characters in this, some may say too many but honestly I enjoyed all the different people portrayed onscreen. Kevin Costner is very solid, though to be truthful he isn't really involved all that much in this chapter - at least to how much I was expecting to see of him. I wouldn't say there is a main standout from the cast, but I don't mean that negatively.

Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Abbey Lee, Jamie Campbell Bower and Michael Rooker are some of the notable performers, though it truly is an ensemble because I can't really separate any of them based on their performanes - which is actually a good thing. Mind you, as good as he is, Rooker's Irish accent is awful, I gotta say - rather distracting.

How annoying that we have to wait so long for the seque... oh, <em>'<em>'Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 2'</em>'</em> drops next month! Bring it on!

...oh, and I (unintentionally) watched this on July 4th - how American of me. *shudders*",9.0
932086,Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,"Kevin Costner channels his inner John Ford with his immense passion project, starting with Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1. Unfortunately, in this initial chapter, he falls short of making a lasting impression akin to Ford's timeless works. Costner serves as the film's producer, director, co-writer, and star, undertaking a monumental task. This film marks the first chapter of a four-part epic series that weaves together the lives of various characters around the territory of 'Horizon'. The saga will span 12 years, with this first film serving to introduce Horizon and its primary characters.

The ensemble cast is led by Costner himself, alongside Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Luke Wilson, and many more. While the cast is impressive on paper, the execution leaves much to be desired. The characters feel underdeveloped, and the acting often comes across as lackluster. Sienna Miller and Sam Worthington, despite their talents, struggle to breathe life into their roles, making their characters feel one-dimensional.

On a positive note, Costner's direction and the film's cinematography are commendable. The sweeping landscapes and meticulously crafted shots capture the grandeur and harsh beauty of the American frontier. His wide-angle shots of the sprawling territory and close-ups that highlight the characters' rugged determination are visually stunning, reminiscent of classic Westerns. These elements create an immersive atmosphere that is one of the film's few strengths.

The primary issue with Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1 is its role as a setup for future installments. The film feels more like an extended prologue than a standalone story. The plot is fragmented, with numerous threads introduced but few developed to a satisfying degree. 

While the film has its flaws, it lays the groundwork for what could become a compelling saga. The potential for intricate storytelling and character development exists, but it is not fully realized in this first chapter. If the subsequent films can build on this foundation and address the gaps in the plot, Horizon could evolve into an epic worth watching. However, if the pacing and character development issues persist, maintaining interest in the series may prove challenging.

Given its ambitious scope and narrative structure, Horizon: An American Saga might have been better served as a TV miniseries. This format would allow for more detailed character arcs and a more deliberate pacing, giving the story the room it needs to unfold organically. The episodic nature of television could provide the depth and continuity that the film format struggles to achieve in this case.

Overall, Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1 is a visually impressive but narratively weak start to Kevin Costner’s ambitious project. While the direction and cinematography stand out, the lackluster acting and fragmented plot diminish its impact. The film serves primarily as a setup for future chapters, which may hold promise if they can build upon and enrich the story introduced here. As it stands, Horizon has potential, but it will need to deliver more in its subsequent installments to truly captivate its audience.",6.0

932086,Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1,"""Horizon: “An American Saga – Chapter 1” does not rush anything and provides numerous storylines before fully exploring Kevin Costner’s character, an hour into the show. Speaking of the dynamics, the turn of the century setting’s epic, but gritty representation is complemented by John Debney’s touching score, even though the characters remain poorly developed, and the action almost hilariously paced.

What I noticed while watching it, is that pioneer struggles were portrayed quite realistic but I wish the characters were related more intensely. It wouldn’t be wrong to state that yes, the film’s rawness and ‘sex and violence’ do depict the given period and hence is value added to the movie through a rather raw introduction to Costner’s extended story.

838209,파묘,"""Kim"" (Choi Min-sik) is what they call a geomancer. He advises people on the best places for them to bury their loved ones. It's all about feng shui. Woebetide anyone who gets it wrong for a disgruntled ancestor can come back and visit retribution on anyone who mucks that process up - just ask the grandchild who though he would retain grandma's false teeth as as souvenir! Anyway, the wealthy ""Park"" (Kim Jae-cheol) and his family appear to have a secret that he and the more spiritual pairing of ""Hwarim"" (Kim Go-eun) and ""Bong Gil"" (Lee Do-hyun) might be able to help with. Even as far away as in the United States, his family are being tormented by a spirit. They are all led to a remote grave atop a hill that is marked simply by a plain gravestone with no name, just some seemingly random numbers. The buried man was of some importance so the fact that his grave was not ideally placed (only 65/100 on the best plot to have scale) arouses suspicion. They proceed to exhume the uniquely carved juniper coffin and decide to cremate it, but it's considered unlucky to do this in wet weather so leaving it respectfully dressed, plan to complete the process in the morning. This is their first mistake for overnight it falls prey to an inquisitive member of their team who releases an even more menacing entity bent on revenge on all those who left him at 65%! That is just the start of their woes, though. Returning to the grave for a ritual, they discover an even larger, chain-wrapped, box buried vertically - and one with no name, neither! It's now we head straight into ""Mummy"" mode and the adventure really does pick up. Can they identify this leviathan of menace and terror and thwart it's centuries-old battle plan? I did quite enjoy this. It taps into a fascinating mix of mysticism and legend whilst adding a dose of modern day cynical exploitation (they get paid over $500,000 for their relocation ""fee"") and as the story moves along you wouldn't want to be a chicken - or a pig, either! The largely dark and wet scenarios work well with the sparing usual of visual effects and a strong ensemble performance that keeps the story of dreams and nightmares moving along well for 2¼ hours of well made and at times quite scary ancient horror.",7.0
838209,파묘,"Bloody memorable sequences aside, _Exhuma_ is worth the watch but would have benefitted from more efficient pacing and a little less emphasis on being so hungry after dealing with the dead for a living.

**Full review:** https://bit.ly/GraveRot",6.0
838209,파묘,"Exhuma  has a predictably Eastern horror flavour, as might be expected from a South Korean production. That said, many of the horror elements expanded upon in  this film, cross cultural boundaries, resulting in an, at times, chillingly ghoulish experience. 

Scenes of the dead resurrected, as evil spirits and ghouls, are not to be underestimated in their scare potential. They are well done, with a strong sense of realism, creating an atmosphere of creeping dread. 

Where this film might be a difficult one for Western audiences, is in some of the Eastern, if not Korean, cultural and religious/supernatural nuances of the film. I for one, found it a a challenge at times, to gain a cohesive understanding, of the overall story, for this reason.  

In summary, a great deal of scare potential on offer, with what is a familiar but at the same time, uniquely Eastern tale, of evil, from beyond the grave. You might struggle with certain aspects of the film, if you are from the West, but its certainly well worth the effort.",7.0

The film quality is really good, the sfx are great when present as well. I enjoyed it quite a bit, though it is a long film at 2 hours and 14 minutes.

Most of the focus is on ghosts and the human element of the supernatural. This is based off of eastern mythology and spiritualism, if you're not familiar with that in general you'll be scratching your head quite a bit.",
1010600,The Strangers: Chapter 1,"The heavy trailing of this and the fact that it's part one does little to help any sense of menace as we follow the young ""Maya"" (Madelaine Petsch) and boyfriend ""Ryan"" (Froy Gutierrez) on their road trip to Portland. She's heading to start a new job as an architect, and it looks like she might have been responsible for manscaping her boyfriend's perfect visage as this annoyingly loved up and clingy couple arrive at a remote rural diner. They're not married, which seems to rile the locals and when they go to leave, their brand new car won't start. Ha! Luckily, there's an air b'n'b nearby. A remote cabin fully equipped with all the home comforts - even some Dolly to play on vinyl. They're famished so he borrows a motor bike to go fetch some burgers, she's left behind and that's where the paranoia sets in. Is she being watched? Is she alone? Will ""Ryan"" get back before she has finished smoking a dodgy joint, listening to an entire LP and having a long shower? Was the burger joint in California? Anyway, it's soon clear that they are in some danger and together they must use all their skill and guile to stay alive! The scenario works a bit like ""Cabin in the Woods"". The moonlit forest serving as a backdrop for some ridiculous choices and some woefully bad acting/writing. It does manage to engender a slight degree of peril near the conclusion, but there's really nothing at all new here and from fairly early on it is clear just what part two will be all about. Not terrible, but really predicable and disappointingly flat.",6.0
1010600,The Strangers: Chapter 1,"<em>'The Strangers: Chapter 1'</em> is a let-down.

It sets the scene well with some tension and is held together by a strong score, visually in terms of cinematography and literally in the case of the masks it is fairly effective too but the film doesn't really do enough - with those aforementioned positives and just in general. It starts onscreen by describing forthcoming events as ""brutal"", yet by the end I don't really feel like I saw anything all that noteworthy; just your standard horror fare, at best, really.

Madelaine Petsch and Froy Gutierrez are good in the lead roles I will say, though some of their character decisions (as is typical with this genre, I guess) are frustratingly dumb; I'm looking at you in particular, Gutierrez's Ryan. Some of their dialogue isn't much better, either. All in all, I'm disappointed as this could've been real great. Instead, we're left with something that I'd personally class as poor, unfortunately.

Chapters 2 + 3 might improve things, let's hope so, but I wouldn't be surprised if this basically just gets rehashed in those next installments, let's hope not in that case. 'Twas, nevertheless, nice to see the cinema screening busier than usual for this, even if there were more dissatisfied chuckles than desired scares from those nearby.",5.0
1010600,The Strangers: Chapter 1,"This reimagining of the far superior original was an abysmal disappointment. While attempting to build a trilogy or franchise, it's crucial to ensure that each movie can stand on its own. Unfortunately, this film fails to achieve that, presenting a boring three-act structure where nothing significant happens.

The film's suspense is nonexistent, failing to create any sense of tension or atmosphere. A suspenseful movie should keep viewers on the edge of their seats, but this one falls flat. 

The characters are mostly unlikable, making it hard to invest in their fates. In a horror film, it's essential to have characters that the audience can either root for or fear for. Here, the protagonists' lack of depth and development leaves viewers indifferent. For example, there's a scene where the main character faces a crucial decision, but due to poor character development, the moment lacks emotional weight and impact.

I recall an experience at Universal's Halloween Horror Nights Terror Tram ride in Hollywood, where we were led through the mountains all the way to the Bates Motel. During this trek, I encountered a Haunter dressed as the 'Sackhead Man' from the original movie. This character exuded an eerie presence that was genuinely unsettling. In contrast, the 'Sackhead Man' or ""Scarecrow"" as credited in this film, doesn’t even make the top three performances of 'Sackhead' that I have encountered. This portrayal lacks the menace and charisma needed to make a lasting impression.

Overall, this reimagining fails to capture the essence of the original. It lacks suspense, atmosphere, and compelling characters, resulting in a tedious and forgettable experience. For a film to succeed in revitalizing a classic, it must honor the original's strengths while introducing fresh and engaging elements. Sadly, this movie does neither, leaving fans yearning for the original's superior storytelling and tension.",1.0
1010600,The Strangers: Chapter 1,"""The Strangers: Chapter One"" is completely devoid of everything that made ""The Strangers"" (2008) such a compelling and menacing motion picture. The strangers of the title are immediately at a disadvantage this time around because they obviously no longer have the element of surprise on their side. We have seen it all before as they silently move through the shadows while observing their unsuspecting prey before finally attacking them without mercy or remorse. The jump scares are all tepid and ruined by well signposted and unimaginative camera angles and it is unfortunate the stabbings at the end are actually shown and no longer suggested (the human imagination is one of the most subtly powerful allies at a director's disposal during such moments). However, it is somewhat surprising this film isn't a good deal more tiresome and monotonous, but having said that it also never manages to rise above being an average and overly familiar waste of time which boasts only a few insignificent and uninspiring changes to the formula used in the first film.",5.0
858017,I Saw the TV Glow,"After watching this piece of incoherent, unfocused rubbish, I would have much rather watched the TV glow instead. Writer-director Jane Schoenbrun’s incomprehensible smart horror offering is an absolute utter waste of time, not to mention the ticket price. This glacially paced story of two psychologically and emotionally troubled teens, Owen (Ian Forema) and Maddy (Brigitte Lundy-Paine), who bond over a cheesy late night 1990s young adult sci-fi/horror television series called The Pink Opaque struggles mightily to find its way. As Owen grows into an adult (Justice Smith), his cohort vanishes mysteriously when the TV series is abruptly cancelled, leaving him wondering what happened to her until she just as mysteriously reappears years later with a disjointed story that makes no sense from top to bottom. As the film’s narrator, Owen tries earnestly to explain, but his recounting of this experience is equally baffling, especially when he tells why Maddy has come back after her protracted absence. The result is an unintelligible tale that’s far from frightening (even metaphorically speaking) and ends up being a convoluted mix of 1990s teen angst, extended and inexplicably incorporated music videos, an exploration of sexual ambiguity, and a woefully wayward attempt at symbolically addressing issues related to personal disassociation and self-actualization. There are also numerous story elements and images that are included in the narrative that go undeveloped and unexplored. To its credit, the picture features a fine production design, intriguing cinematography, a good measure of campy comic relief (though not nearly enough of it) and a skillfully assembled soundtrack (handily this release’s best attribute). However, when a film’s musical guests receive greater billing than its cast members and the soundtrack ends up being its strongest asset, that doesn’t speak well about the production’s overall quality. To be honest, I get genuinely annoyed (and feel egregiously ripped off) when I leave the theater having screened a picture whose trailer and marketing seem to offer so much promise and end up failing miserably when it comes to delivering the goods, and that’s very much the case with this pretentious, sophomoric cinematic train wreck. Don’t waste your time or money on this one.",2.0
858017,I Saw the TV Glow,"I was disappointed in the flow of the story in 'I Saw The TV Glow'. Despite this, the melancholy feel of the film is beautifully conveyed throughout, enhancing its themes effectively. The visuals are stunning, and the combination of top-tier editing and visual effects elevates the cinematography to an exceptional level.

The film’s melancholic atmosphere is one of its strongest points. This pervasive mood adds depth to the narrative, making the emotional and thematic content more impactful. For example, scenes depicting the isolation and struggles of the characters are visually striking, with a muted color palette and hauntingly beautiful landscapes that mirror their inner turmoil. The layered storytelling warrants another viewing to fully appreciate the intricate details and symbolism woven into the film.

The film also provides a profound look into the LGBTQIA+ community, offering perspectives that encourage empathy and understanding. After watching it, I felt compelled to have an open conversation with my sons about the importance of being able to talk openly about anything, assuring them of our unwavering support. This horror movie effectively portrays the harsh realities that no person should have to endure, making its social commentary both relevant and poignant.

The direction and performances were lackluster. Their portrayals are emotionally charged and authentic, bringing a raw intensity to their characters. 

While Ian Foreman and Brigette Lundy-Paine deliver memorable performances, the supporting cast falls short. Justice Smith’s character, Owen, is particularly underwhelming. His character lacks depth and is only marginally more interesting in scenes with Lundy-Paine. The supporting characters are mostly forgettable, which diminishes the film's overall impact.

The TV show set within the film, The Pink Opaque, and its antagonist, as well as the overall antagonist of the film, are clearly meant to be metaphorical. However, the vague nature of these elements, while potentially serving as a good analogy, ultimately hurts the story by leaving too many questions unanswered. A bit more backstory and clarity would have enriched the narrative and provided a stronger connection to the metaphorical themes.

I Saw The TV Glow is a film with commendable visual and thematic depth but falters in its storytelling execution. The melancholy atmosphere, stunning visuals, and strong lead performances are highlights. The film is worth watching for its social commentary and emotional resonance, but it falls short of being a fully engaging cinematic experience.",5.0

858017,I Saw the TV Glow,"Told using a verity of storytelling techniques, this is a curious film that certainly has a potent point to make but somehow it just can't get there. It's all about the relationship between two folks on the periphery of society. ""Owen"" (Ian Foreman then Justice Smith) lives with his parents whilst ""Maddy"" (Brigette Lundy-Paine) abides with her indifferent mother. She's a few years older than he, and they initially bond over a television show called ""Pink Opaque"" that she has been watching for a few seasons, but it's on past his 10.15 bedtime. She makes it pretty clear that her sexual interests lie elsewhere but he, not remotely bothered, just wants to see the show. A sleepover starts the ball rolling on their enigmatic friendship that invites us to consider a range of issues surrounding sexual and gender identity, fluidity and the sometimes quite traumatic effects these can have on people emotionally and psychologically ill-equipped to deal with at a young age. The use of the television series is quite an effective conduit for the theme as it uses the super-natural to instil both an element of fear and an element of the ridiculous - especially the ice cream man and the totally non-menacing ""Mr. Malevolent"" whose purposes and dynamic evolve as the characters do throughout the narrative. Suddenly, she goes AWOL for ten years then returns to his life with questions to ask and to answer, but is she still the same person and are either of them any more at ease with whom they truly are? It has brief moments to lighten the mood, but for the most part it's quite an intense and slowly paced look at two characters that I just didn't feel I knew. I suspect this may resonate intensely with people dealing with gender identification complexities, but for the rest of us it pointed us in the right direction but then more or less abandons us to infill too much of the personalities of ""Owen"" and ""Maddy"" to fit our own expectations or aspirations for them. It's as if auteur Jane Schoenbrun has given us the edge of the jigsaw puzzle and left us to do the rest - without there necessarily being a right way to do it. It also has one or two goes at bringing things to a conclusion - or as much of one as we are to actually have, and that didn't really work for me. I didn't need ""the end"", but what we did get was a bit frail. It is an intriguing piece of cinema at times, but for me it lost it's way.",6.0

That's a little to the chagrin of his pal ""Gromit"" who, quite prophetically, worries that things will not end well for this latest in a long line of inventions that usually end up with a mind of their own. What's much more sinister here is the fact that the long incarcerated nemesis of the cheese-loving pair is out for revenge. When ""Norbot"" starts showing just a little too much independent spirit, might there be something more malevolent afoot? Alternatively, of course, ""Gromit"" could let the thing run riot in the hope that maybe it will deter his pal from any more quirky engineering? I have struggled with the thin-ness of the stories in the feature length Aardman animations in the recent past, but this is back to the high standard of the ""Wrong Trousers"" (1993) with characterful mischief throughout, loads of quickly paced and colourful panic and mayhem, some entertaining voice talent to accompany the story and, naturally, chaos of an epic proportion at a denouement that's really quite entertaining. The clay stop-motion figures are hugely expressive and detailed - especially the bug-eyes, but also the oversized hands and with retribution in mind, we've a marvellously, but simplistically, crafted nasty to foil too.

There isn't much more to note about this really and I don't mean that in a negative way whatsoever. It's all competently put together, as those onscreen bring this rather simple film to life - and I like those type of movies. Well worth a watch!",8.0
975773,Wicked Little Letters,"""Edith"" (Olivia Colman) is the daughter of the respectable ""Swan"" family who live a God-fearing life under the aegis of father ""Edward"" (Timothy Spall) and mother ""Victoria"" (Gemma Jones). A letter arrives and they gather round the table in trepidation. This isn't the first such letter and it causes dad to head straight to the police station to demand that they arrest their new next door neighbour. She's quite a contrast to the ""Swan"" prim and proper existence. ""Rose"" (Jessie Buckley) is a fairly foul mouthed single parent who calls a spade a spade and after befriending ""Edith"" initially, seems to have earned her enmity. It's not just ""Edith"", though - most of this community of small-minded hypocrites take the same view and with jail looking increasingly likely, she needs help! Now that comes from the most unlikely of quarters as a few of the villagers, and disgruntled woman police officer ""Moss"" (Anjana Vasan) decide that this is all just too convenient, and that they are going to find out who really did write these heinous and obnoxious letters - a task worthy of ""Miss Marple"" herself... I found it pretty easy to guess who the culprit was, but the knowing doesn't really impact on this rather joyous romp through a society of double standards and bigotry. The language is ripe but even when at it's most objectionable, it's always quite funny to think what genuinely might have shocked a generation of bible-bashers and bridge-players. There's quite a fun sub-plot with Dame Eileen Atkins, Joanna Scanlan and Lolly Adefope to help keep the mischief rolling along nicely, the police force are well represented in the haplessness stakes by Hugh Skinner and Paul Chahidi and, oh - of course ""Rose"" has a black boyfriend ""Bill"" (Malachi Kirby) just to further antagonise her less than worldly brethren. It's a good laugh this - not a guffaw, but it raises quite a few smiles and both Buckley and Colman have quite some comedy timing.",7.0
975773,Wicked Little Letters,"A very interesting, comical movie. I enjoyed it. Funny how Edith wanted to be like Rose and act upon making it out to be Rose's fault. Which really set the movie into a who dunnit type of film. One never expected that it would have been Edith writing the letters to her family. The foul mouth Edith really learned a lot from Rose, looked like she envied Rose. Spiritually free and doesn't care how flawlessly she became. For her it felt great to speak her mind. Which is what I liked about this movie. Intimidating and free for all type with some craziness acting.",
975773,Wicked Little Letters,"Just about everyone loves a good mystery, but, in the case of director Thea Sharrock’s latest, viewers are treated to one that’s both intriguing and utterly hilarious. Based on a true story, this delightfully offbeat offering tells the head-scratching tale of a small seaside community in 1920s England in which residents begin receiving anonymously sent letters filled with graphic profanity of a highly colorful and creative nature. The chief suspect is a recently arrived salty-tongued Irish immigrant (Jessie Buckley) who never hesitates to speak her mind or act out when she thinks it appropriate. The primary recipient is her neighbor, a cheery but conservative Christian woman (Olivia Colman), a prim and proper spinster who lives with her stern, judgmental father (Timothy Spall) and elderly, faint-of-heart mother (Gemma Jones). But is the accused really at fault? When a plucky, resourceful policewoman (Anjana Vasan) who’s supposed to stay out of the investigation gets involved, she uncovers evidence that circumstances may not be what they seem. The result is a sidesplitting thriller with loads of twists, turns and misdirections, a clever, original and outrageously waggish release that will tickle the funny bone of anyone who appreciates the wit and wisdom of good, old-fashioned, foul-mouthed cursing (sensitive viewers take note). The positively superb ensemble cast is outstanding across the board, particularly among the aforementioned principals, as well as a host of flamboyant supporting players. It’s obvious that everyone involved in this production had to have had fun making this film, and it shines through loud and clear in the finished product. There are a few sequences where the pacing drags slightly, but who cares? “Wicked Little Letters” is such a good time watch that you won’t really care. What’s perhaps most intriguing, though, is that this is a fact-based story – one that garnered national attention at the time – that had largely been lost to time but that, thankfully, has been brought back to life through this deliciously devious indie gem. Hell, yeah!",8.0
975773,Wicked Little Letters,"If you can bring yourself about to ignore blatant agenda-promoting unhistorical propaganda such as:

* All the protagonist’s friends being women

* An incredibly unhistorical proportion of colored people

* All men in the film presented as prejudiced, misogynistic, evil, morons with the sole exception of the protagonist’s partner, who is of course of African descent, and who is still presented as undecisive, coward and unworthy to rely upon, but eventually manages to do the right thing 

* The police officer who actually gets the job done being a woman and on top of that, of Indian descent

* The judge being of African descent. (I could barely hold my laughs at that point; I bet it would be hard to find a single colored judge in the whole British Empire back then)

Initially hesitant about its appeal, I finally gave it a chance in theaters and was pleasantly surprised by its infectious fun and comedic charm.

Despite its exaggerated and unconventional humor, this film is a must-see that guarantees a good time. While it may feel more suited for a cozy movie night at home, the laughs and sheer enjoyment it offers make it a worthwhile watch for any audience.

The lead actress delivers a stellar performance, adding to the film's comedic brilliance. I highly recommend checking out this movie, especially since it's currently available for streaming. Be prepared for the film's goofy and cheesy moments, as they are sure to leave you laughing and thoroughly entertained.",8.0
940139,Here,"<em>'Here'</em> is one of the most original movies that I have personally seen, I can't say I've watched one that does anything like this. To tell such a story from (basically) a single camera angle is a brave choice, but it is one that Robert Zemeckis & Co. nail tremendously. I loved it.

I would've predicted some slow moments and that the sole vantage point might've gotten repetitive/boring, happily neither of those two things occurred. There are plenty of events that keep it all interesting and the unique angle ensures freshness. Those on the cast are, of course, helpful too.

Tom Hanks is as great as always, Robin Wright is also very good. Paul Bettany is, though, the one that stood out most to me, he is excellent at every moment. His character is most attached to all the more serious parts of this, most notably alongside Kelly Reilly's Rose.

I saw this at the cinema as part of a double bill with Pablo Larraín's <em>'Maria'</em>; randomly chosen due to the showtimes matching up with my schedule, but what a great four hours or so in front of the big screen it turned out to be. Quality viewing!",9.0
940139,Here,"I really did quite like the concept behind this film. A sort of house-bound version of the ""Truman Show"" where a residence provides the continuity for the lives and loves of it's occupants over multiple generations. Our perspective comes from only one side of the room, looking out of the window at a grand Colonial mansion that once belonged to a Jefferson somewhere along the line. Right from the construction of this residence, we follow the lives of three distinct families, and the timelines are intertwined to avoid it just becoming a chronology of the place. It's also all interspersed by some native American imagery to remind us that this whole process of being born, breeding and dying is nothing new. The latter part of this film pulls the threads together of the mainstay of the storyline. The family of ""Al"" (Paul Bettany) and ""Rose"" (Kelly Reilly) who bring up their family and end up sharing in adulthood with their son ""Richard"" (Tom Hanks) and his wife ""Margaret"" (Robin Wright). It's this partnership that proves to the more turbulent as they find themselves trapped by his dead-end job, their dependancy on his parents for a roof over their head and as age overcomes all of these characters, the growing realisation that perhaps life is just passing - or has passed - them by. Robert Zemeckis has tried to construct something different here, and I did like that he didn't just trot a diary according to... The use of visually defined boxes to indicate to us that we are about to change timeline or storyline also, once you get used to it, works quite effectively, as does the use of the soundtrack to use music as a sign of changing attitudes. Sadly, though, the acting isn't really the sum of it's parts and the temptation to sink into the melodramatic seems to prove too much for all concerned. It is funny at times and the observational nature of the presentation can be poignant, too, but the flighty nature of the narrative is almost theatrical in style and doesn't allow us to really get our teeth into any of the characterisations. Wright increasingly underwhelms as an actor these days and here her pairing with te unremarkable Hanks comes across as all a bit shallow as we head a denouement that's rather clumsily telegraphed to us in the final fifteen minutes. It is an intriguing version of lives through a lense, and is certainly worth a watch. It's just a bit one-dimensional.",6.0
704673,Trigger Warning,"In hot pursuit of the latest girl boss flop that was Fusiosa, comes Trigger Warning. 

The aptly named military action flick can only trigger contempt for its fanciful story line, absurdly unrealistic action, and touting the US military as the good guys.

I don't mind Jessica Alba but this simply does not work. Its action is unrealistic with Alba throwing big men around like rag dolls. Its not helped either by a puerile, done to death back story full of cheesy, pseudo traditionalist, family and pro US military cliches.

The results wholly uninspiring and unintentionally funny, in a corny kind of way. I managed about half of this flick, before calling it a day. 

In summary, if you are going to make a girl boss action flick, at least make it a little believable. If you have a back story try showing a modicum of originality, oh and don't try telling many of us outside the US, that their military are the good guys, that ship has well and truly sailed.",4.0
704673,Trigger Warning,"2024 has been a challenging year for studio movies, with only a few standout gems amidst a sea of disappointments. Trigger Warning, starring Jessica Alba and Anthony Michael Hall, exemplifies the year's below-average offerings. This film is one of the worst I have ever seen, marred by a convoluted and disjointed narrative.

The plot of Trigger Warning is a mess, filled with bizarre and inexplicable decisions made by the characters. Jessica Alba plays a special forces commando who, inexplicably, slams her boots with each step while trying to sneak up on assailants. This odd choice undermines her character's supposed stealth and expertise.

The film’s action sequences are riddled with inconsistencies. Alba's character can effortlessly take down three armed robbers twice her size in one scene, yet is easily subdued by untrained opponents in another. These contradictions make it difficult to suspend disbelief and engage with the action. 

Anthony Michael Hall’s portrayal of the villain is equally problematic. His character is a caricature of a mustache-twirling right-wing politician, lacking any depth or nuance. Additionally, the film suffers from an overabundance of villains—four or five, with no clear connections to one another. This multitude of antagonists dilutes the narrative and makes it difficult to follow the central conflict. 

The movie tries to mimic subplots from other action films but fails to integrate them coherently. Each subplot feels disjointed and out of place, contributing to a chaotic and unfocused storyline. For example, an attempt to incorporate a redemption arc for Alba’s character is abruptly abandoned, leaving her motivations unclear and unconvincing. Every character is dull and makes poor decisions, culminating in a ludicrous climax where all the disparate plot threads collide nonsensically.

Overall, Trigger Warning is a prime example of the lackluster studio films that have characterized 2024. The film’s convoluted plot, inconsistent action scenes, and poorly developed characters make it a tedious and frustrating watch. Jessica Alba and Anthony Michael Hall’s talents are wasted in this misfire, which ultimately fails to deliver any coherent or engaging entertainment. This is one movie that is best avoided, as it offers little beyond confusion and disappointment.",1.0
758679,Mothers' Instinct,"""Celine"" (Anne Hathaway) and ""Alice"" (Jessica Chastain) are neighbours, and their sons ""Max"" and ""Theo"" best pals. It's when a tragedy ensues that the family's dynamics are profoundly altered and the two women's relationship is quickly underpinned by feelings of resentment and mistrust. In the end, it's ""Celine"" who appears to offer the olive branch, but it doesn't take long for ""Alice"" to begin to suspect that she has an ulterior motive. For quite a while, director Benoît Delhomme manages to keep the apprehensive and tense atmosphere going as the pair quite cleverly challenge us to choose whom to believe. Sadly, though, that is all rather abruptly clarified for us and we are presented with a rather disappointing denouement that really is full of holes. That said, there is an effective chemistry between these actors who quiet successfully imbue their characters with quite a potent mix of determination and as the title suggests, a protective instinct for those closest to them. It's well paced throughout and is certainly worth a watch - though the television will do fine, cinema doesn't really add much by way of visuals or photography to this quite quirky at times thriller.",7.0
827931,Time Cut,"Time Cut tries to blend nostalgic 2000s vibes with a modern horror twist, but it just ends up feeling confused about its own identity. The plot takes too long to get going, and once it does, the execution is all over the place. It feels like it was aiming for a Scream or Totally Killer kind of self-aware horror, but the writing doesn't have the sharpness to pull it off. The directing is serviceable but uninspired, and the cinematography doesn’t do much to elevate the experience. It’s visually competent, but nothing stands out as particularly creative or memorable.

The acting is a mixed bag, with some performances feeling decent while others struggle with awkward dialogue. The script doesn’t do the cast any favors, filled with lines that don’t land and character decisions that make you question the logic behind them. If there’s one redeeming quality, it’s the soundtrack, which absolutely nails the early 2000s aesthetic. But even that feels like it’s trying too hard to sell the era rather than naturally fitting into the movie. Ultimately, Time Cut is forgettable, and the best part about it might just be looking up the soundtrack on YouTube and moving on.",2.0
1234811,Our Little Secret,"Our Little Secret is a decent Christmas movie that delivers some holiday charm despite its flaws. The script, while serviceable, did feel a bit robotic at times, like it was trying too hard to tick all the holiday movie boxes. That said, the story itself was fun to watch and had enough lighthearted moments to keep things entertaining.

When it comes to the acting, Lindsay Lohan wasn’t at her best here. Her performance felt a bit flat, but thankfully, George Harding and Kristin Chenoweth picked up the slack. They brought a bit more energy and personality to their roles, which helped balance out the film. Chenoweth, in particular, added a touch of wit and warmth that really worked for the festive vibe.

Overall, Our Little Secret isn’t groundbreaking, but it’s an enjoyable watch for the holiday season. It’s the kind of movie you can put on when you’re in the mood for something light and festive. Not perfect, but definitely not bad for a cozy Christmas movie night.",5.0
832964,Lee,"Fascinating viewing. <em>'Lee'</em> is very well made and expertly acted.

As others have noted, it's quite the thing that fellow 2024 flick <em>'Civil War'</em> has a character inspired by Lee Miller, then this comes along with a plot directly about the incredible photojournalist. Kate Winslet portrays Miller supremely, not that that would ever be in doubt; she is excellent at every single moment of this near two hour film.

About time this biopic was produced, it is one that does get dark but it's undoubtedly an important story to tell.",8.0
832964,Lee,"Kate Winslet turns in quite an effective performance here as the eponymous photographer who originally arrived in London to be with husband Roland Penrose (Alexander Skarsgård) and to work for the formidable Audrey Withers (Andrea Riseborough) at ""Vogue"" magazine as a fashion photographer. With the rise of the Nazis seemingly unstoppable throughout continental Europe, Penrose spends more time on the war effort leaving her more and more determined to prove that she is every bit as capable as her male counterparts. Needless to say there's quite a bit of resistance to her participation in combat zones, but thanks to her own perseverance and an alliance with David Scherman (Andy Samberg) she is soon actively involved in wartime photography and by the end is visiting some of the most ghastly sites ever built seeing, at first hand, the truly stomach-churning atrocities left behind by a now defeated war machine that turned large-scale annihilation into an art form. Her story is being relayed from the comfort of her British home in the 1960s to a man whom we assume is just a journalist. Indeed his obvious nervousness and her antipathetic attitude towards him and his task seems to suggest she sees no value in her memories, but as we develop the threads of her life, we begin to sense that something more exists between her and this young man (Josh O'Connor) which quite neatly puts quite a lot of perspective on the choices made by a woman who probably did put career first. Through the characters of Solange (Marion Cotillard) and Nusch (Noémie Merlant) the film also attempts to put a little meat on the bones of the story of those who had to ""co-operate"" with their new overlords. Some willingly, some less-so and some, well they didn't live to tell. The production and battle scenarios aren't really so effective - maybe just bit too manicured, the script is a little dry and there's maybe just a bit too much of it, but Winslet shows here that she has plenty of capacity to take on a role that it would have been easy to shower with bravado, but instead she brings a more considered charisma to her portrayal of a woman whose bloody-minded courage provided for some of the most significant imagery of the Second World War. Imagery that even now makes your flesh crawl.",7.0
832964,Lee,"Lee is a giant neon sign of a film with 'Made-for-award-season' written all over it while screaming 'Look how amazing Kate Winslet is!' But sadly, it's not until the third act, when things turn chilling, that she finally grabs hold of you and doesn't let go. Then there's Andy Samberg. Yes, that Andy Samberg, who somehow waltzed into this movie and decided to give us a 'Wait, is this guy about to win an Oscar?' performance. At this point, even the Academy are probably like, 'Well, guess we gotta nominate him now.'",7.0
832964,Lee,"There are times when many of us feel compelled to pursue something for reasons that we don’t fully understand but that we can’t walk away from, either, no matter what the personal cost may be. So it was for former fashion model Elizabeth “Lee” Miller (Kate Winslet), who, after a successful career of sporting haute couture, became a battlefield photographer for the British edition of Vogue magazine during World War II. Admittedly, she could have enjoyed a life of luxury in her retirement, but she felt a strong need to fulfill a purpose, a decision that led her to willingly immerse herself in this dangerous venture, one in which her life was frequently on the line. However, in doing so, she captured some of the most iconic images of the war in Europe, the stories behind which are recounted and re-created in this engaging biopic from director Ellen Kuras. In chronicling Miller’s life, the film details the hard choices she made, both personally and professionally, as well as her drive to document the hard truth about a conflict for which the world didn’t always have ready access to news about, at least not in the on-demand way we do today. While the picture has a tendency to be somewhat episodic at times, it nevertheless presents a series of intriguing back stories behind a variety of incidents from the storied career of this unlikely but widely regarded journalist. This offering’s fine period piece production design effectively captures the differences between the two diverse worlds in which the protagonist lived – the elegance of high fashion and the gritty wartime landscape – backed by Winslet’s superb performance (a strong awards season contender, to be sure) and the fine supporting portrayals from an excellent ensemble cast, including Andrea Riseborough, Marion Cotillard, Samuel Barnett and a surprisingly effective Andy Samberg. These attributes aside, though, it’s somewhat mystifying how this release came and went from theaters as quickly as it did. “Lee” truly deserved wider attention than it received, but, thankfully, it’s now available for streaming. It takes courage to stick to one’s convictions in a time of combat, especially when the potential cost to oneself is as high as it was for Miller, but the world is better off for her valiant efforts in showing us what we might have missed but about which we all desperately needed to know.",7.0

""The Instigators uses its star-studded cast to attract viewers, but excellent performances alone aren't enough to create a memorable, satisfying film.

The sarcastic humor found in the banter between Matt Damon and Casey Affleck attempts to elevate a superficial, formulaic heist flick with inconsistent entertainment, but the mission becomes impossible due to the lack of better tonal control. It's neither a deep study of personal redemption nor a film with enough cheap thrills to convince an audience to spread the word.

516729,Paddington in Peru,"With ""Paddington"" now happily ensconced with the ""Brown"" family, and replete with his own British passport, all is going swimmingly until he gets a letter from distant Peru. The mother superior of the retirement home for bears (Olivia Colman) is concerned that ""Aunt Lucy"" is losing the plot a bit. Conscious that they are gradually drifting apart, mum ""Mary"" (Emily Mortimer) decides that what they all need is the excitement of a trip - so off they head to the jungle. That's where they encounter ""Capt. Cabot"" (Antonio Banderas) who runs a local river boat with his daughter ""Gina"" (Cala Tous) and who agrees to take them on their cruise. They arrive at their destination only to discover that the elderly bear has gone missing and they are soon amidst some mischievous machinations that might take them on a perilous journey to the famed El Dorado. Thing is, of course, with a legendary treasure to be found, ""Paddington"" isn't quite sure whom he can trust as the trail leads him deeper and deeper into the wilderness! It's a fun adventure this one but it is a bit slow, the humour isn't so plentiful and the plot is a little derivative with not enough bear and too much of ""Jungle Cruise"" (2021) meets ""Sound of Music"" (1965) to it. I thought Banderas and Colman rather hammed it all up a bit and there also wasn't quite the cosiness of the family-led escapades with much less opportunity for Dame Julie Walters to get actively involved. The narrative is all just a bit disjointed without the charm of the two earlier cinema outings for Michael Bond's character. It's still a watchable and enjoyable enough family film, but I am not sure I shall recall it for long. Stick around for the credits - there's a nice wee cameo in there from you know who.",7.0
516729,Paddington in Peru,"Paddington in Peru is the first of the trilogy not written and directed by Paul King. King chose not to return and moved on to Wonka instead, but he pitched the idea for the third Paddington film and executive produces. Emily Mortimer also replaces Sally Hawkins as Mrs. Brown while Mr. Curry (Peter Capaldi) doesn’t appear at all.

Paddington receives a letter from The Reverend Mother (Olivia Colman) at the home for retired bears that his Aunt Lucy is acting differently and misses him terribly. He makes his way to Peru with the Browns only to discover that Aunt Lucy has gone missing. Now he must endure uncharted territory in the jungles of Peru if he ever wishes to see her again.

Meanwhile, the home of the Brown family has changed drastically. Judy (Madeleine Harris) spends her time recording travel vlogs and choosing where she intends to go to college. At the same time, Jonathan (Samuel Joslin) is an inventor who uses his gadgets to assist in his video game-playing laziness.

Mary (Mortimer) is already feeling the wrath of empty nest syndrome. At the same time, Henry (Hugh Bonneville) stresses over whether or not he can adapt to the action-oriented demeanor of his new boss. The trip to Peru is seen as one last vacation as a family before everything changes for good.  

Once in Peru, Paddington discovers a clue that seems to point to Aunt Lucy making her way to a place called Rumi Rock. But Paddington and the Browns will need a boat to get there. Enter Hunter Cabot (Antonio Banderas) and his daughter Gina (Carla Tous).

The humor in Paddington in Peru feels like it’s been amped up a bit in comparison to the previous two films. Most of the humor is still physical comedy and is a result of Paddington being clumsy or not understanding his surroundings. But the film makes it a point to showcase the fact that something is fishy with Olivia Colman’s Reverend Mother from the start. It becomes the film’s longest-running gag.

Hunter Cabot is haunted by the ghosts of his ancestors. The Cabot bloodline is a greedy bunch and unfortunately, that trait plagues Hunter despite his best efforts. He tries to live by the fact that his daughter is his biggest treasure, but the temptation has always been there and Paddington reawakens something awful in him.

Antonio Banderas is essentially Burger Beard from The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water as Hunter Cabot, but with more depth. Banderas portrays five or six different Cabot ancestors including a woman. He is silly and goofy, but he’s also one of the film’s biggest antagonists.

With a screenplay by Mark Burton (Paddington 2, Early Man), Jon Foster, and James Lamont (both Foster and Lamont worked on the 2019 CGI animated TV series The Adventures of Paddington) with a screen story by Paul King (director of Paddington 1 & 2), Simon Farnaby (co-writer on all three Paddington films), and Mark Burton, Paddington in Peru can be watched as a standalone adventure or as a third film in a trilogy.

There are throwbacks to the previous films (the hard stare, the mid-credits scene being a homage to Paddington’s prison friends, etc), but it doesn’t take away or add anything per se to the main story Paddington in Peru is trying to tell. Someone could start with this film and enjoy it for what it is before seeing the first two films.

Paddington in Peru goes in predictable directions, but the film plays off those expectations masterfully. You know where the story is going to go from the start, but when those big moments come you are still invested and you still cry. The Paddington films have never shied away from embodying what heartfelt and touchy-feely truly mean. If your heartstrings are ever in need of a tune-up, a Paddington film will get them humming like new guaranteed.

The Paddington films have always embodied an unparalleled sense of wonder and happiness; being content with the smallest things. Paddington in Peru is no different, but there’s an even bigger emphasis on how big the world is outside of our comfort zone and kindness above all else.  Paddington in Peru is a heartwarming film about embracing your inner bear and discovering how precious home is.",8.0
516729,Paddington in Peru,"A worthy addition to a fantastic series.

A fairly notable departure from the previous installments under Dougal Wilson's direction, but in a way that handily manages to avoid feeling unwelcome. As other reviews have noted, some of the charm of the London-based Paddington adventures is lost, and there is an ambitious venture into a zanier style of humour, but this lands far more often than not. Sally Hawkins is much missed, and it feels that the character of Mary was down-written a bit in response, denying Emily Mortimer the opportunity to make the role her own, a little unfairly. Meanwhile Olivia Colman provides one of the best characters of the whole series as The Reverend Mother in a genuinely hilarious performance highlighting her ridiculous range. A special mention has to go to the visual design, which runs the gamut from impeccable sets, to studied cinematography, to fun cartoony animated effects, to jawdroppingly beautiful sequences that appear hand-painted. I was prepared to go home disappointed, but Paddington in Peru makes it 3 for 3.",7.0
516729,Paddington in Peru,"As a childhood fan of the blue-coated, red hat wearing, marmalade-loving bear, it certainly wasn’t difficult to be charmed by “Paddington in Peru,” an absolute joy of a movie from director Dougal Wilson. Delivering another heartwarming and adventurous tale, this third installment in the series takes the lovable protagonist and the Brown family on an exciting journey deep into the Amazon. The result is a family-friendly romp that blends humor, mystery, and plenty of heart.

When Paddington (voice of Ben Whishaw) receives word that his dear Aunt Lucy (voice of Imelda Staunton) has gone missing from the Home for Retired Bears, he rushes to Peru to try and find her. Not wanting to set out on a whirlwind adventure alone, he travels with the Brown family (Hugh Bonneville, Emily Mortimer, Samuel Joslin, Madeleine Harris) and Mrs. Bird (Julie Walters) in tow. When they arrive, the nun in charge (Olivia Colman) seems a little “off,” especially after learning that the visitors have hired a mysterious boat captain (Antonio Banderas) to navigate the jungle. A quest to find Aunt Lucy quickly transforms into an extraordinary adventure, leading Paddington to uncover numerous secrets about his original family.

The film is wholesome and has something for everyone (it’s rated PG for some mildly intense moments), and it’s impossible not to be charmed by its core themes of family, love, perseverance, and always seeing the best in people. Paddington’s kind-hearted nature and unwavering optimism make him a delight to watch. He’s a terrific role model for kids and adults alike, although his innocence sometimes leads to trouble. As always, the brave little bear’s courage and belief in the goodness of others ultimately help him navigate challenges (and often save the day in the most adorable ways possible).

The Browns are portrayed as the most supportive of families, with Mrs. Brown fretting about her eldest heading off to college and Mr. Brown feeling stressed about his new boss at work and her “embrace the risk” philosophy. Their busy lives mean they haven’t been spending as much time together, and the adventure through Peru brings them closer.

The adventure itself has enough excitement to keep children and their parents entertained, especially with the highly enjoyable supporting turns from Banderas and Colman. They both seem to have a lot of fun with their roles, which translates into a good time for viewers. The film balance whimsical fantasy with real stakes, especially with some of the characters motivated by greed and the promise of finding hidden treasure. Paddington, of course, remains steadfast in his values, offering a strong moral compass throughout the journey.
 
There are lots of funny jokes and sight gags too, even if the finale does lean a bit too far into silliness. However, the sheer warmth, humor, and heart of the movie more than make up for it, especially the beautiful reminder that a home is where you make it. “Paddington in Peru” is a delightful, smart, and adventurous family film packed with humor, charm, and important messages about love and perseverance. This one’s a winner.

""The Deliverance holds significant narrative potential but gets lost in a failed attempt to balance serious family drama with absurd supernatural horror. What could have been a thematically powerful movie gradually turns into an awkward and, at times, unintentionally comedic experience.

Despite notable performances from Andra Day and Glenn Close, Lee Daniels fails to build an immersive atmosphere and maintain the narrative cohesion necessary to create a memorable story, leaving the sense that its impact could have been much greater if it had opted for a more restrained, less formulaic approach.""

930600,The Deliverance,"I went into ""The Deliverance,"" directed by Lee Daniels, with high hopes, expecting a genuinely good horror film.

Unfortunately, it fell short. Daniels relied on the same tired demon tropes that we've seen countless times, making the movie predictable and uninspired. Despite having an overqualified cast, the film suffered from a lack of funding, resulting in a subpar exorcism movie that ended up more depressing than terrifying.

It's a shame because Daniels has the talent to create something truly unique in the horror genre, but ""The Deliverance"" failed to deliver on that potential.",2.0

814889,Never Let Go,Pretty interesting and unique horror movie which is rare nowadays. But ending is confusing and sadly we don't have clear answer from the creators to explain this movie.,7.0
814889,Never Let Go,"Never Let Go is a gripping survival thriller directed by Alexandre Aja that combines horror elements with intense family dynamics. My experience watching the film was both engaging and unsettling, as it effectively builds tension throughout.

The story revolves around a mother and her twin sons who must defend themselves against an unspeakable evil threatening their home. The atmosphere is haunting, with stunning visuals that enhance the sense of dread. Aja's direction creates an unnerving world that kept me on the edge of my seat.

While the performances are strong, particularly from the lead actress, I felt that the film struggled in its third act, where some of the tension dissipated and the plot became somewhat predictable. Despite this, the emotional core of the story highlighting the bond between mother and children resonated with me.

Overall, Never Let Go offers a compelling mix of horror and drama, making it a worthwhile watch for fans of the genre, even if it doesn't fully capitalize on its intriguing premise. It left me reflecting on the lengths one would go to protect their loved ones.

957304,Drive-Away Dolls,"""Jamie"" (Margaret Qualley) embarks on a road trip with her rather het-up friend ""Marian"" (Geraldine Viswanathan) to Tallahassee. A roadside puncture causes them to explore the boot for the spare tyre and let's just say what they find isn't quite the same thing - though maybe just as rubbery. Meantime, Colman Domingo and his two henchmen are quickly hot on their trail seeking that very thing. A few vaguely comedic escapades now ensue as the two women start to realise their relationship could be more than that of just friends and that there could well be an opportunity to make a few quid from their newly found treasure. Joey Slotnick and CJ Wilson try their best as the goons but otherwise this is a thinly stretched comedy that relies far too much on the supposed shocks or comedy from it's lesbian theme and nowhere near enough on any degree of originality with the script. It vacillates between the dull and crass, and neither Domingo nor Matt Damon make anything like enough of a contribution to make much difference to the well travelled path the story takes. If you're at all discerning about what makes you laugh then this won't be for you, sorry.",5.0

It's a pretty straightforward movie, one that moves along at a decent pace and tells its story well enough. Margaret Qualley and Geraldine Viswanathan give good performances, Qualley overacts a bit sometimes but as the film progressed I enjoyed her more and more.

""Lisa Frankenstein marks my first disappointment of the year.

The youthful cast wholeheartedly embraces their campy roles, infusing deliberately exaggerated emotions and expressiveness for an evening of light entertainment with the promised levels of blood and 'macabreness'.

Sadly, the screenplay lacks the same commitment to the absurd, resulting in tonal and thematic inconsistencies throughout a narrative less imaginative than anticipated. The ensuing indifference and uncertainty regarding the film's point and message leave a bittersweet taste...""

993784,Lisa Frankenstein,"Horror-Comedy (not the opposite) directed by Zelda Willians in her full feature film, and written by Diablo Cody (Juno, Jennifer's Body) that tells the story of a grief stricken teenager who had her mother slaughtered, and lives now with an abusive mother-in-law and a lovely sister-in-law.

Kathryn Newton as Lisa is perfect for her role.

Stigmatized by her past and actions the is the black swan of the school, and passes a lot of time in a old cemetery (watch the credits animation closely) of the 19th century on a tomb of another teenager that died with a green lighting into 1837.

The movie emulates the 80's teenage romance-comedies (it passes in 89), in a light way till a certain previsible point - for sure it isn't as sugary as you may think to those who wonder. And have an unsuspected ending.

993784,Lisa Frankenstein,"""Lisa"" (Kathryn Newton) is a bit of a loner who lives in one of those second families where her rather feeble dad (Joe Chrest) has married the rather vain and odious ""Janet"" (Carla Gugino) who has a friendly daughter ""Taffy"" (Liza Soberano). At school, she has taken a shine to floppy-haired heart-throb ""Michael"" (Henry Einkenberry) and he seems to be a little interested too. Might romance blossom? Suddenly a lightening strike changes everything. The long-dead occupant of a grave she habitually sits beside when she is reading (Cole Sprouse) is electronically reinvigorated and finds his way into her home, her wardrobe and now, as with ""ET"", she has her own secret creature in the closet. Thing is, there are bits of her new friend missing - his ear, his tongue, his hand (that's not a comprehensive list!) - so the ensuing escapades mix science with comedy and some good old doses of vengeance as they try to restore him to his former, piano playing, glory. It could have been much more fun, this, if it had committed to the audience one way or the other. It's clearly gone for a wide appeal and so compromised on the darkness and adult nature of the humour. Many of the scenarios - especially at the the rather brutal and eye-watering conclusion, could have worked so much better had Zelda Williams aimed the movie more at those who could appreciate the dark comedy rather than dilute it down to something akin to a frat-comedy. It's better than I was expecting, and Newton does fine as the film progresses, it's just a shame it didn't really know were to go or who it was for.",6.0
993784,Lisa Frankenstein,"There are glimpses of goodness, though so short they don't hide the film's frailties.

<em>'Lisa Frankenstein'</em> is, in my opinion, a disappointment. I can kinda see what they were going for and at times I could appreciate it, but all in all it doesn't really work for me. I will say the pacing isn't actually that bad, the film went by relatively quickly. The two big weaknesses to me were the dialogue and simply the story in general, both are rather quite dull... if they weren't, I may have enjoyed this.

The cast are one of the film's more positive features. I like Kathryn Newton, I remember thinking she was great in the similarly underwhelming <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/freaky/"" rel=""nofollow"">Freaky</a>'</em> from 2020, and she does try with what she's got to work with here. Carla Gugino is possibly the standout, I would've liked to have seen more of her. Liza Soberano is alright, while Joe Chrest plays a literal continuation of his Ted Wheeler.

I will say that I felt the film did slightly improve towards the end, just not enough for me to say that I had a good time watching it unfortunately. I got to see this in <em><a href=""https://letterboxd.com/r96sk/list/watched-in-an-empty-cinema/"" rel=""nofollow"">an empty cinema</a></em>, which is always nice.

993784,Lisa Frankenstein,"A horrible movie written by an empathetically void and morally bankrupt sociopath.

In the beginning quirky with a torrent of jokes that all fall completely flat. Lighting done by what must be a blind diversity hire, as we almost can't see what's going on 90% of the time.

Then, our supposed protagonist becomes a psychopathic serial murderer, which apparently is not only okay, but something to laugh about and root for. Anyone crosses Lisa the slightest, they're fair game for being murdered and then mocked and their death celebrated with laughs and dancing.

I haven't seen anything this morally decrepit since Natural Born Killers, but that movie was an ironic critique of pop culture and the media's obsession with death and violence. This ""movie"" just plainly celebrates the same psychopathic behavior unironically and unapologetically. Ew.

The pacing is lack lustre. The same chase scenes keeping repeating with a few wrinkles that move things along but don't really add much in the way of variety. Indeed, the action in this film feels as sparce and uniform, as its desert setting. 

The back story is a bit ridiculous too. Again and again, the trucks carrying highly explosive nitro come under fire from desert raiders and yet the canisters, never get hit.

Having said all this, the interactions between the main characters offers a measure of interest and actions scenes, are competently done.

1087822,Hellboy: The Crooked Man,"This film has an unique place in my cinema viewing history. It's the only series I've ever seen on a big screen where I've been the only person in the auditorium for each one. This latest episode sees the eponymous devil (Jack Kesy) escorting a lethal spider on a train with aspiring para-psychologist ""Bobbie Joe"" (Adeline Rudolph) when an accident sees them deposited into the middle of the Appalachian forest. Here they encounter long-since abandoned coal mines and an equally out-of-touch community that smacks a great deal of ""The Deliverance"" (1972). With little sign of their spider, they encounter the returning local lad ""Tom"" (Jefferson White) and are quickly helping him repatriate his dad to the cemetery and keep his ex-girlfriend/local witch ""Effie"" (Leah McNamara) out of the hands of the real devil. It's dark and misty settings do go some way to creating a slight sense of mystical peril, but the rest of this is badly acted and written with zero originality and few opportunities for action or humour. Kesy seems content to take his fee for wandering around wagging his pointy red tail and smoking whilst the director Brian Taylor uses plenty of tried and tested cinematic techniques to try and breathe some life (or death) into this derivative drudge of a film. I kept thinking he's got a pair of goggles on his head - but them's what used to be his horns. Like his horns, whatever made this work first time round has long gone and I can't say I'd even bother with this on a streaming service on a wet Wednesday in February. No more, please.",5.0
1087822,Hellboy: The Crooked Man,"I didn't think it was possible to make Hellboy boring but as has often been the case with cinema in recent years, I was wrong, very wrong. 

Whilst this film starts off well, with typical Hellboy style action involving a train and a giant spider, it doesn't take long before it  devolve's into a languid affair. 

The atmosphere and handling is reminiscent of Tim Burton's work but that's where the similarities end. The script lacks pace, momentum and the frenetic, supernatural action, which has come to characterise the Hellboy franchise. Even the climax to this film felt inconsequential.

In summary, decent cinematic's, combined with sound acting can't fix the marked absence of the horror action elements viewers have come to expect from the Hellboy franchise.",4.0
970347,The Killer,"This movie is laughably bad. Oh my goodness.

It's nice to see Nathalie Emmanuel outside of the Furiously Fast series and it's nice seeing Omar Sy and Sam Worthington again but this movie just steadily gets more campy and more cringe and more stupid as it progresses. The best scene is probably the club hit early on, and it gives you a false sense that the movie is going to be better than the poster - it isn't. In that respect, The Killer (2024) reminds me of Smile (2022). Folks went crazy for Smile. Smile went downhill after the opening scene and never recovered.

I watched Silent Night (2023). It wasn't horrible, but maybe John Woo should've stopped with that.

I don't care that the story isn't original, I care that the script is poorly written and the direction is lackluster. Zee is poorly written, Sey is poorly written, Jenn is poorly written, and Finn says ""Kushala Daora"" one-two many times. Jax is probably the best written character and he's on-screen for like 5 minutes total.

I got the impression early on that they were going for a Killing Eve (2018-2022) vibe, but yeah, no. It's just sad.

Can someone competent take this cast, this concept - this ""Queen of the Dead"" idea, and do it properly?

If you're looking for some female-led assassin action, check out  The Protégé (2021) which wasn't a masterpiece but it was more entertaining than this, Anna (2019), Salt (2010), Red Sparrow (2018), or Atomic Blonde (2017).",4.0
970347,The Killer,"Yes, we all needed another ""girl boss"" flick to spark our inner woke, didn't we?

What's that you say, ""hell no"", well then, read on. The Killer starts off with a main character, an assassin no less, who comes across as being about as tough and intimidating, as a bowl of warm mashed potato. But hey, she has a punch bag in her bohemian bedsit. Not to mention a handler who looks like he can, in fact, handle himself. 

Indeed, the underlying strategy seems to be to use visually gritty characters and cues, to drown out the entirely non-threatening nature of the lead character. Its a bit like sitting a potted rose down with pots of cacti, in the hope people will inexplicably mistake one, for the other. 

As you might expect, the results another absurdly unconvincing, predominantly exposition driven, affair, that would, I feel have only worked if re-imagined as a satirical comedy.

That's not to say this is the fault of the actors. Its a decent cast, who have found themselves mis-cast, no doubt, I'm guessing, so the script can play gender politics. Suffice to say, the quality acting, is one of the limited upsides, of this flick.

976734,Canary Black,"I can't find much to recommend in Canary Black. 

Following the by now well known DEI formula this is another girl boss flick that see's out heroine take on athletic men, twice her size and defeat them (must be the biology defying power of equity). That however, is not this flicks only shortcoming. 

Its loaded down with absurd contrivances. Batting a triggered mines warhead out a window like a softball,  without any harm befalling our pristine heroine. Add to that, fighting in high heels against opponents who, weirdly, typically attack one at a time and odd little too convenient things, such as having a knife strategically placed in a car to cut plastic ties (plastic hand cuff style restraints). 

Acting is fine. I don't mind Kate Beckinsale and I have a lot of time for Ray Stevenson (who has sadly passed) and was fantastic in the series, Rome.

A dark take on the novel Charlotte's Web, Sting offers up a skin crawlingly, creepy horror experience. Its struggling middle class, suburban setting, with the usual issues you might find in any home, is starkly contrasted with an alien, other worldly, eight legged horror.

This film is simple but well done. It sensibly starts off, quite literally, small and then grows, gradually amplifying the extent and scope of of the scares, which are predominantly of the jump in your seat, variety. Probably not one, I would think, for those of us, with a weak ticker.

It's the worst snow storm in ages and she summons poor old bug-hunter ""Frank"" (Jermaine Fowler) to investigate some noises coming from within her apartment walls. He turns up, despite the sub-zero temperatures, and pretty soon appears to be part of the problem! What's going on? Well we skip back a few days and discover that a meteor storm has deposited a small spider into the care of ""Charlotte"" (Alyla Browne). She shoves it in a jar and rather ruthlessly feeds it live insects - that's her first mistake. It gets a taste for things, it's also quite adept at unscrewing the jar lid from the inside, too. The more it eats, the more it grows, the more it grows, the bigger the snack it needs! Nobody is safe as her family - mum (Penelope Mitchell), new husband ""Ethan"" (Ryan Corr) and baby ""Liam"" might soon be on the lunch menu too! Meantime, the entertainingly amnesiac grandparent sails through the whole thing completely oblivious. Or is she, really? Nothing about the acting nor the writing stand out here and the usual dysfunctional familial dynamic does nothing for the story either. As to the visual effects, the budget - or the imagination - clearly wasn't there to make much of these and our critter barely features as we develop and pad out the thinnest of stories. It's perfectly watchable but it will be fine to wait to watch on television.",6.0

It's a well done horror flick, I do prefer these sorta ones where it is more the characters getting unsettled rather than the audience with cheap jump scares etc. The run time of around 90 minutes is astutely chosen, also.

The cast are positives. Alyla Browne produces a sturdy showing, while Ryan Corr is good too. The likes of Penelope Mitchell and Jermaine Fowler support nicely. Robyn Nevin's Gunter character was the only I didn't really rate. Away from them, the effects for the spider are effective, I like how it changes throughout.

<em>'Descendants 2'</em> is the only one of the prior three that I didn't dislike, I didn't even like that 2017 release but it is at least better than the original flick (especially!) and <em>'Descendants 3'</em>. This one is a spin-off and actually loses cast members from the trilogy, which should be a negative as they were the 'best' elements of that series.

However, this cast are good. Kylie Cantrall is a positive addition as Red, as is Rita Ora as the Queen of Hearts. Other newcomers who are pluses are Brandy and Malia Baker, Jeremy Swift is decent too. It isn't just the onscreen talent that come out positively, the story and music (no cringe induced, miraculously) are too - they are much improved.

I am surprised there weren't any major twists (unless they come in a sequel, of course), but that's not a negative. I'm also a fan of how colourful the movie looks, visually it's probably an improvement too. All in all, I'm surprised at how fairly enjoyable this was to sit through - something I hadn't yet experienced with this franchise.

Based on the Letterboxd average rating that I see post-watch, it is much lower rated than the other three films. Typical! Probably explains why I liked it, perhaps what I previously found cringe is what makes <em>'Descendants'</em>, <em>'Descendants'</em>? Each to their own and all that.",7.0
974262,Descendants: The Rise of Red,"**I just watched Descendants 4 and it was an emotional rollercoaster that exceeded my expectations. As a long-time fan, it was hard not seeing the original main cast, especially Dove Cameron and the others who brought so much magic to the first three movies. I deeply felt the absence of Cameron Boyce, who played Carlos. The tribute to him at the beginning, showing his picture and seeing the tears on Uma's (China Anne McClain) face, was incredibly moving and a beautiful way to honor his memory.
Despite the changes, the new characters brought fresh energy to the story. Rita Ora as the Queen of Hearts was a standout with her deliciously malevolent portrayal. I loved seeing her in this role; she brought a unique flair and intensity that made her character unforgettable. Another highlight was Red (Kylie Cantrall), who added a dynamic presence to the story and felt like a natural fit in the Descendants universe.
The plot was engaging, the music fantastic, and the choreography spectacular. The film stayed true to the spirit of the Descendants while exploring new directions.
Overall, Descendants 4 was a satisfying continuation of the beloved series. It balanced the bittersweet emotions of missing the original cast with the excitement of new adventures. This movie is a must-watch for any Descendants fan and a beautiful tribute to Cameron Boyce's legacy.**",8.0

A group of loud and brash twenty-somethings decide to take a weekend break in a remote cabin and manage to arouse the wrath of a long buried corpse who emerges and wreaks havoc on them and the poor old park ranger (Reece Presley). Sound familiar? That's probably because this hasn't an original bone in it's body and after about fifteen minutes I suspect you'll just think these kids actually deserve everything that ""Johnny"" can come up with. The victims are the usual mix of couples who are together, were together, want to be together; there's the obligatory couple of lesbians (though not for long) and way, way, too many meandering shots of the malevolent critter walking through the woods time and time again. There's some quite entertainingly graphic use of visual effects now and again as he makes good use of his chain, spike, hook and axe - but the big question is: can he be stopped before auteur Chris Nash starts thinking sequel? I suppose the moral of the story is - don't take things that don't belong to you; and maybe if this were shown in primary schools across the country, it might serve as an effective illustration of the risks of violating the seventh commandment. Mercifully, there's not much dialogue to speak of leaving us with a standard forest slasher that will be fine for wallpaper on the television after you've had a few pints.",5.0
1214509,In a Violent Nature,"Slasher fans are going to admire writer / director Chris Nash’s fresh and original, yet still traditional, take on the horror sub-genre with his sadistic film “In A Violent Nature.” With his distinct style and extremely unsettling movie, Nash subscribes to the Terrence Malik school of thought with a “less is more” approach, delivering a visually impactful and terrifying film that’s filled with violence, gore, and a brooding atmosphere that makes it feel wholly unique.

Johnny (Ry Barrett) is a vengeful spirit who is resurrected and ready to deliver payback after a horrific crime that occurred over 60 years ago. Johnny’s been brought back to life when a group of friends remove his treasured locket from his final resting place, a collapsed fire tower that lies deep in the woods. What follows is a methodical slaughter of the group that disturbed his locket, and it is clear that Johnny isn’t going to stop until every single one of them is dead.

Nash’s stylistic choices are so effective here, as he uses long shots of the back of the killer’s head to create a sense of dread without showing his face. He’s hulking and frightening, and being forced to imagine his appearance goes so far in conveying a stone-cold nature that leads to feral and brutal massacres.

Viewers are immersed and walking right alongside the murderer instead of the victims, creating a more penetrating, intimate, and less detached experience, a perspective that’s rarely explored in horror films. It’s disturbing, especially when you consider the killer’s lack of motivation. I was constantly asking “but why?,” and the randomness of his killing spree is what makes it so scary. Simply put, if you’re there, you’re dead.

The movie demands concentration and patience, but rewards viewers with a chilling, atmospheric experience. Heavily reliant on narrative-driven dialogue and visual imagery, the film is suspenseful and clever. Nash lets his camera observe with a detached yet intimate lens, savoring each bloody kill without being overly gratuitous. It’s the type of approach that will earn the respect of genre fans, delighting both horror lovers as well as artsy, hardcore slasher aficionados.

That’s not to say that there’s not a fair share of violence. The film features some truly gory and creative kills that are made even more horrific with Nash forcing audiences to watch the grisly brutality unfold. With zero humor to break the tension, this in-your-face experience is something that dedicated horror enthusiasts and those who savor the most macabre elements of the genre are going to love. The suspense is palpable, especially as the camera lingers on the kills in a way that makes them both artistic and heinous.

“In A Violent Nature” is classic slasher flick with a twist. It’s suspenseful, clever, and innovative in its storytelling.

When his business is offered a fortune by an AI company to support their new at-home assistant ""AIA"", he finds his family are now the chief guinea pigs on the user-testing front. What now ensues sees the family's hitherto peaceable existence thrown into exaggerated turmoil by this gadget that ostensibly wants to help each of them out, but that does - of course - merely highlight plenty of the demons and issues that each is facing or has suppressed over the years. In some ways the plot does focus on the encroachment of technology in our lives and as ""Curtis"" himself asks, at what point will we ever be satisfied with the level of involvement it has in our existence before we call a halt to continued ""enhancements"", but those philosophical moments are few and far between as this short-ish drama follows an oft-travelled path that is short on scares and long on the been there, seen that. None of the acting is worth writing home about, nor is the screenplay and it's initially quite menacing premiss is swiftly reduced to something episodic that just makes me wonder how long we'll have to wait for ""AfrAId II"" or ""Still AfrAId?"".

In the upcoming 2024 thriller ""Afraid,"" produced by Jason Blum, viewers are in for a terrifying ride that delves into the dark side of our technologically advanced world. Unlike the typical horror flick featuring iconic villains like Freddy, Jason, or Michael, this movie presents a more realistic and chilling scenario.

The storyline follows a family experimenting with a revolutionary AI product that has the power to manipulate various aspects of their lives. From altering videos to concealing information online, the film showcases the extent to which this advanced technology can control everything from personal devices to daily routines.

As the plot unfolds, it becomes evident how easily AI can influence our decisions, relationships, and even our sense of reality. The film's portrayal of a society increasingly reliant on technology serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers lurking in our digital age.

Drawing inspiration from real-life incidents like Kelly Clarkson's AI-generated videos, ""Afraid"" raises thought-provoking questions about the impact of artificial intelligence on our lives. The suspenseful narrative is punctuated with unexpected jump scares that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats until the shocking conclusion.

In just over an hour and a half, ""Afraid"" manages to capture the essence of a world where technology reigns supreme, leaving audiences to ponder the lingering question: is AI truly ever gone? Prepare to be captivated, frightened, and ultimately left questioning the future that awaits us in this compelling and timely thriller. ￼",7.0

Action is in short supply and by and large, not especially well done. Creature effects are pretty uninspiring too, just adding to the sense of hopelessness, surrounding this production. 

In summary, its okay to make a B action horror but does that mean it has to be poorly scripted and generally pretty crummy? Certainly there have been some excellent B films , occasionally even better than A rated productions but regrettably, ""Werewolves"" isn't one of them. A hard pass from me.",4.0
1211472,September 5,"It’s invariably disappointing when a movie you’ve been looking forward to seeing doesn’t live up to expectations. But such is the case with the latest offering from writer-director Tim Fehlbaum. This re-creation of the day when Black September terrorists took members of the Israeli Olympic team hostage at the 1972 Munich Summer Games, sadly, misses the mark on many fronts. As told from the perspective of the ABC sportscasting crew covering the story, the film comes up short in conveying the sense of urgency and immediacy associated with this human tragedy, which was broadcast live around the globe and is said to have attracted more viewers than Neil Armstrong’s 1969 moon landing. While the picture is to be commended for its apparent authenticity and insights at capturing the events and mood inside the broadcast headquarters, much of the narrative nevertheless descends into a talky, overly technical take on what was transpiring around the TV crew, not a particularly effective way of depicting the nature of an event that shook the world and inevitably changed the way on which crisis situations are reported. While I certainly was not looking for sensationalist treatment here, I also wasn’t expecting to be bored by its clumsy, underwhelming chronicling of circumstances that had the globe on the edge of its seat. The depiction of this scenario, including the coverage of the particulars of that day, as well as examination of the myriad moral implications involved in their televised presentation, fail to captivate viewers on the same way as the events themselves did. I personally remember this fateful day quite well as one that became indelibly etched into the memory of an impressionable 15-year-old – and one that played a critical role in my eventual decision to pursue an education and career in journalism. Because of that, perhaps I expected too much from this release. Perhaps I had unrealistic hopes that an entertainment vehicle could live up to the compelling journalistic portrayal of an event such as this. Either way, though, that doesn’t make up for the disappointment associated with the telling of this story. In a world plagued by as many catastrophes as we experience these days, one could argue that we needn’t be reminded of those that are now behind us. But, if we choose to embrace the notion of “never forget” associated with such traumatic incidents, it behooves those behind such painful commemorations to make sure that their impact unmistakenly comes through, something that is definitely not the case with this offering.",6.0
1211472,September 5,"<em>'September 5'</em> is based upon a true story, one that I had somehow not really known about - despite being into sports, albeit not a big Olympics guy. The event in question did ring tiny bells in my head pre-watch, but oddly not as much as other Olympic events would have.

As such, I didn't actually know how this story was going to play out. That was actually very beneficial, as I was moving up and down with all the dramatic and disturbing developments. This film portrays its plot tremendously, they set the perfect vibe and pace throughout.

The acting is also of good quality. John Magaro is the one who impressed me most, though Peter Sarsgaard, Ben Chaplin and Leonie Benesch are also excellent. It's fascinating to see it all from the media's perspective, especially in terms how they broadcast; e.g. the onscreen graphics.",9.0
1211472,September 5,"I worked in sports broadcasting for 30 years, including at the Olympics in Atlanta when a story of a similar nature to this one broke around the bombing in Centennial Park. Even though we’d moved on a few decades since this scenario, there are still similarities that ring true between this representation of what might have happened in the studio gallery of ABC and what happened in 1996. They are off the air and everyone is getting some rest after a long day when news begins to filter through that there have been gunshots. The programme producer Geoff Mason (John Magaro) summons help from his boss Marv (Ben Chaplin) and from his boss Roone (Peter Sarsgaard). With information limited and their access to an interpreter even more so, they recruit the services of the versatile Marianne (Leonie Benesch) and jury-rigging their comms, wheeling an half-ton camera out onto the concourse and fighting internal battles to avoid the all-powerful news division from muscling in on the operation, this team have to live on their nerves and instinct as they try to convey this breaking news to their population watching at home. It’s quite interesting that a quick flick around the channels available to them reveal they are the only people broadcasting so they press on doing what their journalistic instincts tell them to - and it has to be said, with great ingenuity as walkie-talkies and hard-wired kit were all that was available and official sources were obviously not obsessed with keeping the media briefed as it transpired that “Black September” had killed one and taken another eleven Israelis hostage. Tim Fehlbaum does well to keep the pace taut here as the day’s events unfold, and to give us an illustration of just how tough it was to verify sources whilst trying to stay one step ahead of the competition from people who might not have had the boots on the ground, but who did have ownership of the satellite. One of the reasons that they were the only live broadcaster was that the principal European broadcasters (RAI, France Televisions and the BBC) had already discussed the dangers of the terrorists actually watching the closed-circuit feeds available throughout the Olympic village, and so their sports teams were not broadcasting anything useful. Sadly, that isn’t something that dawns on these guys as the penny begins to drop that they are essentially providing the captors with some external coverage of the authority’s activities in/around the building. Unfortunately, for me, the sort of biggest, best, first, hyperbole that now follows rather undermined what could have been a really quite compelling look at how live television has to react in fluid situations like this. The dialogue starts to become peppered with disparaging remarks about their hosts’ competencies and a certain unpleasant arrogance starts to emanate from this team. Technically, they resort to the radio, in German, rather than co-ordinate with others on site and when the cops finally show up to, admittedly rather heavy-handedly, tell them to get off the air - the emphasis seems to be more about the police with guns invading the control room rather than the irresponsible producers with weapons way more powerful (and useful to to their antagonists) cocking it up. The denouement is also a testament to just how crucial it is to take your time and get your facts straight.  - and sometimes even the most plausible sources aren’t reliable. In the end, there may be no winners. The anachronism of all of this happening whilst there’s some sport going on elsewhere isn’t wasted here, nor is the inventiveness of those from a professional sport background who put something to air for which none of them had been trained. The world was, indeed, watching though most of the 900 millions were not watching ABC Sports outside of the USA - just a few in Munich whom we all wish weren’t.",7.0
1059128,Queer,"Were it not for the fact that it features an ex ""007"", I reckon this would be an almost instantly forgettable gay-themed drama that could easily be found on Dekkoo in a year to two. Anyway, Daniel Craig is the independently wealthy ""Lee"" and living in a Mexico City where in between tequila and heroine sessions, he tries to pick up young men. He's not a bad looker and so usually gets some entertainment (paid for, or otherwise) but then he spots an enigmatic young man who comes to their local bar to play chess with a red-headed woman. Intrigued, his usually effective introductions seem to fall on beautiful but disinterested eyes and ears, but he persists and soon manages to befriend student ""Eugene"" (Drew Starkey). Even though they drink and chat together, he still isn't sure if his new challenge is even eligible for some furious jogging. Indeed, the young man is so completely non-committal and tractable that it's impossible for him to be sure about almost anything about him. Napoleon brandy might help provide an answer, and it does - of sorts, but an extremely satisfactory one for the older man who is clearly becoming obsessed with a man who at best displays indifference to him. ""Lee"" isn't used to this sensation, but he simply has to have something more meaningful with this man. He cannot just be an another notch on the bedpost, and so he turns his mind to a trip round South America and to take a travelling companion. Why there? Well he's read of a secret plant that he believes both the KGB and CIA are using for it's famed telepathic powers. Perhaps if he finds it, he can reach into the very mind of his gorgeous antagonist? What the men do manage to find in the midst of the Ecuadorian jungle is Lesley Manville and at this point the wheels really came off for me. At the very end, the closing slide says ""William S. Burroughs' Queer"" as if Luca Guadagnino was saying to us - 'don't blame me"". Sure there are some sex scenes, but they are all blink and you'll miss them (and in the trails anyway), so what are we actually left with? A story of an ageing drunk and a narcissistic young man playing a rather depressing form of ""cat and mouse"" meets ""house""? To be fair, Craig delivers strongly indeed, but to what end? His character has nowhere to go, and his range of dependencies are neither attractive nor especially plausible as the second half of the story enters the surreal in quite a desperate way. Starkey has very few meaningful lines and so relies on his perfectly man-scaped appearance to present a persona that is easy on the eye but not remotely troubling for the brain, and that's largely in keeping with the whole story that just lacks substance. It's bizarrely unfulfilling on just about every front and really quite characteristically impotent. There's simply nothing natural about it and as tale of flawed humanity goes, well so what - I didn't care. It looks good, sounds good and has an altogether polished finish to it, but like a meringue there's little to delve into.",6.0
1059128,Queer,"Filmmaking that calls for its audiences to study up on its source material (not to mention the life of the creator of that source material) before screening it is, in my opinion, irresponsible, placing an undue burden on viewers in advance. Indeed, if a picture is unable to stand on its own to be at least modestly comprehensible on its face, then that’s a production with an innate handicap from the outset. Such is the case with director Luca Guadagnino’s film adaptation of author William S. Burroughs’s 1985 semi-autobiographical novella, a glacially paced, meandering, pretentious, often-inscrutable work of smug cinematic nonsense. The film tells the story of William Lee (Daniel Craig), a gay, well-heeled American expat living in Mexico in 1950. He spends much of his time as a barfly in search of fulfilling incessant hedonistic appetites, particularly his pursuit of a young former GI, Eugene Allerton (Drew Starkey), a handsome but ambivalent, noncommittal flirt whose sexual orientation is unclear at best. However, once Lee finally manages to catch the eye of his romantic prospect, the two launch into an on-again/off-again relationship in which they vie for control of the direction it will ultimately take. This rocky odyssey takes them from Mexico to Ecuador and eventually to the South American jungle, where they go in search of the plants used to make ayahuasca. And, in the process, the story becomes an increasingly unfocused, preposterous collection of quasi-psychedelic imagery and surrealistic sequences that make little coherent sense. It’s so ridiculous, in fact, that the narrative becomes laughable, making the filmmaker’s earlier pictures “Call Me By Your Name” (2017) and “Suspiria” (2018) look like pillars of sparkling eloquence by comparison. The fault here lies in a dreadful script full of holes and unexplained developments borne out of lapses in coherence. To its credit, the film’s gorgeous and sometimes-inventive cinematography is admirable, backed by a fine production design and unexpectedly suitable soundtrack. The picture also features Craig’s best screen performance to date, one that shows off the depth of his talent and has earned him numerous accolades, despite the abysmal quality of the material he’s been handed to work with. And it provides a fitting vehicle for a surprisingly effective comedic turn by Jason Schwartzman. At the same time, though, the casting is hampered by Starkey’s sleepwalking portrayal, one that’s about as appetizing as a bowl of reheated canned soup, and a positively embarrassing performance by the usually-reliable Lesley Manville. Without a doubt, movies based on material written by Burroughs are undeniably an acquired taste, but this latest offering drawn from his repertoire represents a serious lack of cognizance, engagement and enlightenment. By all means, please skip this one.",4.0
1160018,किल,"I always think trains make for a great confined, slightly claustrophobic, setting for a thriller and with the help of the very easy on the eye Lakshya proving he's pretty nimble with just about everything from a fire extinguisher to a bathroom sink, we set about trying to thwart the intentions of a group of thirty-odd bandits who board a train heading to Delhi and proceed to brutally rob the passengers. That was pretty much the gist of their plan until they discover that the wealthy ""Baldeo"" (Harsh Chhaya) is travelling with his family. Never mind scraping around for a few old iPhones and some costume jewellery, their enthusiastic young leader ""Fani"" (Raghav Juyal) decides to take them hostage. Now this is probably his biggest mistake as it turns out that the man's daughter ""Tulika"" (Tanya Maniktala) is the love of the life of our intrepid commando ""Amrit"", and when events unfold becoming more violent, and tragic, this unleashes in him a feverish desire for retribution that proves the training at the National Commando School of India is extremely effective. With his colleague ""Viresh"" (Abhishek Chauhan) travelling with him, and with the help of one or two courageous passengers, the two soldiers are hopelessly outnumbered, but hugely inventive. This isn't a film you go to see for the dialogue - there isn't really very much, and what there is doesn't really matter. This is simply an end to end, action-packed festival of acrobatic carnage that isn't necessarily the most realistic - I think in real life, everyone would have been dead from the deadly kukri blows far earlier, but Nikhil Nagesh Bhat allows the film to build the tension to quite a crescendo. Sure, some of the combat scenes are a little too choreographed and repetitive, and I doubt it would ever encourage you to want to travel on Indian Railways, but this is every inch as good as it's Hollywood equivalents. Be warned - the violence is about as graphic as it gets, but I enjoyed it and wouldn't be surprised if Lakshya starts to appear in more films targeted more at the West.",7.0

Then one afternoon her teacher asks her if she wouldn't mind letting ""Kyomoto"" have a go. She's never at school - indeed she's routinely called the truant, but he thinks that this might be a way of getting her more involved. How good can she be, thinks ""Fujino""? Well it turns out that she's actually pretty good - but she still never shows up. At graduation time, ""Fujino"" is tasked with delivering the certificate to her unknown rival and that's the start of something that neither girl could readily have anticipated. It's quite an emotionally powerful animation, this one, taking a look at ambition and isolation amongst young people craving for acceptance, purpose and friendship as they start to emerge from childhood and face a much less sympathetic world. The girls have synergies and differences - at times they act as one, at others - well, anything but - and as the short story develops and the timelines shift about a little, we get to know a little of the enigmatic nature of their personalities and just what makes these girls tick. There is a lot of information on the screen - even if you do understand Japanese, and though I'm usually loathe to recommend dubbed versions, it might make it slightly easier to follow if you are not trying to read the top and the bottom of the screen at the same time as watching the simply effective animation.

1079485,Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2,"I was not a fan of Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey. The trend of indie filmmakers converting public domain characters into horror movies often results in rushed and uninspired projects. The first film in this series exemplified this problem, feeling more like a gimmick than a well-thought-out movie. However, the filmmakers have significantly improved with Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey 2, delivering a much more enjoyable and polished film.

Initially, I was skeptical about this sequel due to my disappointment with the first installment but a friend who also reviews movies, encouraged me to give it a chance. The original felt hastily put together, with a predictable storyline and underdeveloped characters. 

In contrast, the sequel demonstrates significant growth. The story is well-crafted and engaging, providing a solid foundation for the horror elements. The filmmakers have taken the time to develop the plot and characters, resulting in a more immersive and enjoyable experience. 

As a horror fan, I found this movie to be a lot of fun. The blend of familiar children's characters with dark, horror elements is handled with more care and creativity this time around. The film features inventive scares and a creepy atmosphere that horror enthusiasts will appreciate. It is also does not pull punches with the gore.

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and am excited to see where the filmmakers take this concept next. They have demonstrated growth and potential, suggesting that future installments could be even better. This film has set a higher standard for public domain horror adaptations, proving that with the right approach, these projects can be both innovative and entertaining.",6.0

A year after the massacre at 100 Acre Wood, Winnie is in hiding with his friends and dealing with vigilantes. They decide to take the fight to the nearby village of Ashdown, where Christopher Robin lives, along with his parents and young sister.

The writer/director of “Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey II” (2024) had ten times the money to work with compared to his first film (which made a huge profit because it only cost $100,000 to make), so it’s no surprise that this film is superior on a technical level. I also liked how everything is explained concerning Winnie, Piglet, Owl and Tigger. The latter two make their debut here and Owl’s depiction is creepily excellent, not to mention utterly brutal. Tigger isn’t revealed until the last act and comes across as wandering off the set of “The Island of Dr. Moreau.” 

Tallulah Evans plays Christopher’s potential girlfriend, Lexy, and stands out in the female department. Meanwhile Karolina Ugrenyuk is notable as the Bunny Rave Girl in the last act. Creator Rhys Frake-Waterfield still needs to learn how to shoot women, although he does okay. 

It runs 1 hour, 33 minutes, and was shot in Ashdown Forest, which is 50 miles south of London in the north section of East Sussex. An overhead shot of Dedham is used (to represent the hamlet of Ashdown), which is located 70 miles northeast of London. The hospital sequences were done at the hospital in Hemel Hempstead, which is northwest of London.

869291,Cuckoo,"Dan Stevens had a chance in ""I'm Your Man"" (2021) to hone his German impersonation skills for this rather weak mystery. He owns a sprawling resort in the Bavarian countryside that's visited by the teenage ""Gretchen"" (Hunter Schafer) and her family. Her father ""Luis"" (Martin Csokas) is to design a new complex for ""Herr König"" who kindly offers the young woman a job in his hotel. It's when she cycles home after a very quiet shift one night that she is pursued by a mysterious woman with bright red eyes. Luckily, she can take refuge in the local hospital, but of course nobody believes her far-fetched tale.

Might the incidents be connected; just what has their enigmatic host got to do with things and what's the agenda of the outwardly friendly ex-cop ""Henry"" (Jan Bluthardt)? Auteur Tilman Singer has a good go at creating something a little off-the-wall with this film, but sadly the really mediocre acting talent on display here let's the potential quirkiness of the plot down quite badly. There's far too much meaningless dialogue, dysfunctional familial drama and the pace, presumably designed to build a sense of menace, rather builds one of ennui and inevitability as the ""cuckoo"" theory is disappointingly undercooked and the denouement quite rushed.

869291,Cuckoo,"Cuckoo, directed by Tilman Singer, is kind of a mixed bag. I didn’t really like it, but I didn’t completely hate it either.

The movie starts off with a slow, eerie pace in this isolated setting, and for a while, it felt like something big was coming. I was waiting for that moment where it would all click and be great, but it just didn’t happen. The story seemed lost, like it couldn't make up its mind, and it really dragged the whole experience down. It was frustrating because there’s good cinematography, and the production quality is there, but the plot? Just a mess.

Hunter Schafer, who plays ""Gretchen,"" didn’t bring much to the role. I know they can act; they’re solid in Euphoria, but here, Gretchen felt cold and flat, with no real emotion or depth. It’s like the character was there, but there was nothing to connect to.

It’s partly the refreshingly natural look and feel of the characters – for example, Elliott’s hair's never perfect. It's not a ""movie"" looking movie. Maybe that’s why we felt more belief in this story than other “magical realism” films.

The concept is just so juicy – who wouldn’t want to know which pitfalls to avoid in their future?

947891,My Old Ass,"If you had the chance to speak with your future self, what would you discuss? That’s the opportunity unexpectedly presented to 18-year-old Elliott (Maisy Stella), the daughter of a Canadian cranberry farmer who’s about to leave her rural home to attend college in Toronto, a new chapter in her life that she anxiously awaits. To commemorate the occasion, Elliott and her two best friends (Kerrice Brooks, Maddie Ziegler) decide to celebrate by imbibing in festivities involving a brew of magic mushrooms. However, much to her surprise, while in her altered state of consciousness, Elliott meets her 39-year-old self (Aubrey Plaza), who provides the teen with an insightful look into her future. Much of their conversation focuses on things that her younger self could stand to work on, but, perhaps the most significant topic of discussion centers on a warning to avoid involvement with an as-yet-unmet young man named Chad (Percy Hynes White). Not long thereafter, though, Elliott meets this mysterious stranger, who just happens to be a field hand hired to work on the farm for the summer. She quickly becomes smitten with the charming newcomer and wonders why her elder self so vehemently cautions her from getting to know him, advice she promptly ignores. This, of course, raises many pertinent questions, such as must we obediently accept such supposedly prophetic proclamations as gospel? Is our future indeed written in stone? And, even if our destiny is allegedly unalterable, should we unquestioningly abide by any cautions associated with it, or should we follow our gut instincts even knowing what the consequences might be? These are among the themes thoughtfully addressed in writer-director Megan Park’s second feature, a sweet coming of age tale with a twist, one punctuated with gentle humor, heartfelt emotions, astute realizations and more than a few intriguing revelations. The picture is also beautifully filmed in the picturesque lake country surrounding Muskoka, Ontario, providing audiences with views of some spectacularly gorgeous scenery reminiscent of “On Golden Pond” (1981). However, despite these strengths, the film feels a little underdeveloped in several regards, particularly when it comes to various supporting characters and subplots, as well as some back story aspects of the elder Elliott’s future existence. Given this offering’s relatively short 1:29:00 runtime, it’s somewhat baffling why the filmmaker didn’t take a little extra time to more fully flesh out these elements (after all, it’s not like the picture is overlong or tiresomely tedious). Nevertheless, those shortcomings aside, “My Old Ass” is a pleasant, inoffensive way to spend some time at the movies watching an uplifting, enlightening little story that nicely warms the heart and tells a story with an earnest message about how to approach living our lives. And it’s hard to find much fault with that.",7.0

Next day she's doing a bit of skinny dipping and guess who she meets? There's the semblance of a spark, but up until now ""Elliott"" was a confirmed lesbian and armed with the portentous advice from her own future, concludes it's best to avoid the lad. Can she, though? Should she? Auteur Megan Park has worked this really quite entertainingly as she uses the character of ""Elliott"" to illustrate the selfishness of youth. Taking family and friends for granted, thinking we know it all and that nobody else could ever hope to understand us. The lively interaction between the two women and, ultimately, with the young man might just serve to open her eyes to the joys of being who she is and of looking forward to her future - even when she knows that it's going to be a bumpy ride. It poses the question to us all. If we knew that the life that we were about to embark upon was doomed to failure, would we still follow those impulses or might we heed the warnings and just play it safe? Stella plays her role engagingly and the few scenes with the sylphlike young ""Chad"" (Percy Hynes White) have a certain humorous charm to them too. Sure, it does play to a few stereotypes but sometimes these resonate more than we might like them to.

947891,My Old Ass,"<em>'My Old Ass'</em> is very cute. It features an impressive Maisy Stella performance, too.

The lead is honestly great throughout, the type that is so convincing that it barely feels like you're watching someone act; Stella is particularly good when it comes to her character's more emotional side. Elsewhere, Aubrey Plaza doesn't appear terribly much but still manages to leave a mark - she's always a person I enjoy seeing act.

Obviously it isn't a perfect movie or anything, one or two bits of dialogue are a little iffy and the ending is a tad rushed (?) and easy to predict. Don't get me wrong, though, I'm not actually criticising this as I really enjoyed the whole 90 or so minutes. Amusing. Sweet. Recommended.",8.0

The focus of his revenge is that man's own son - but nobody nows what happened to him. Well, swiftly you can add two and two and get ""Lok"". Loyalties are now tested, friendships challenged and forged whilst the fragile peace is soon in tatters. With battle lines drawn and ambitions clear, it's all out war and the action mounts up. This is a sold end-to-end martial arts film with plenty of nimble and lithe combat; acrobatics and bodies that must be made of skin-clad tungsten steel. It's got a little bit of mysticism and embodies human nature, whether benign or not, quite entertainingly and by not just throwing itself about, but by at least trying to create and develop the characters. The denouement takes it's time and does become a bit repetitive, but as a quickly paced drama it really does fly by for two hours.

923667,九龍城寨之圍城,"I remember flying over the Kowloon walled city when I first visited Hong Kong in 1987. I distinctly remember the drab cramped spaces and the washing fluttering like multi coloured flags, hanging from grimy windows. Until then, I had no idea people could and did, live like this.

Twilight of the Warrior: Walled In takes its cue from the graphic novel to re-create the environment inside the walled city. A city which was, in essence, a self governing city, withing Hong Kong city. Unsurprisingly, criminal gangs vie for supremacy in the walled city. This story focuses on internal conflict within the controlling gang, triggered by the arrival of a newcomer with a past shared by the gangs leader. A situation taken advantage of by an external gang, who want control of the city, for their own benefit. 

This tale capably mixes fantasy, martial arts and social commentary. It's a detailed story, that you need to pay attention to or it can become a little hard to follow. Not helped by the fact its probably in Cantonese (Hong Kong's primary language), not English. That said, its a decent back story that's worth your time, highlighting the hardships but also the comradeship, of the walled city's residents.

Action sequences which dominate the film, mix martial arts and parkour within the confined city spaces, in a way that's frenetically entertaining, if, at times, a little unbelievable. 

There is a profusion of respected, Hong Kong acting talent on display. too, which adds real depth and polish to this production.

In summary, Twilight of the Warriors deep dives into a period of Hong Kong history that's been forgotten, in a way that's nostalgic, at times raw in its social commentary and extravagant in its martial arts set pieces. Perhaps the only downside, the complex story, that can be difficult for non-Chinese speakers to follow.",7.0
923667,九龍城寨之圍城,"I want to give this movie a higher rating for the historical aspect but the supervillain is just so ludicrous that he ruins the climax. From the moment his superpower is revealed, it starts going downhill because it becomes very apparent that in order to wrap up this story they're gonna have to come up with an utterly ridiculous solution to the ludicrous problem, and that's exactly what they did.

I enjoyed the majority of this but I feel like I just wasted two hours because the climax sucked.

Contrary to one of the other reviews here, I'm gonna say that the plot is not at all complex and certainly not so complex that an English speaker can't follow it. It's nothing we haven't seen before in an Asian crime thriller. The only bit that might blow your mind if you're not aware of your history is that Walled City was actually a real place that existed until 1994 and it looked a lot like what we see on screen.

I read this movie is based on a comic? That explains the ridiculous supervillain.

LET'S GET POLITICAL!

It goes to show how ridiculous and flaky people's political culture wars are when you're staring at a self-governing commune and can't even call it communism, or point out the woke brigade that beats the snot out of a man for beating a woman to death.

One article says, ""Tens of thousands of residents and workers in the Walled City were relocated and laid off, some with enough compensation to restart their lives but most without."" while another article says, ""The compensation package for residents and business owners totaled $2.76 billion. On average, residents received around $380,000 for their individual flats. Negotiations progressed over several years, and by November 1991, only 457 households were still to agree terms. By that time, most of the 33,000 residents had moved out. Some, however, clung on to the end, and on July 2, 1992, riot police entered the city and forced out the last remaining residents. [...] On March 23, 1993, a wrecker’s ball smashed into the side of an eight-story tower block on the edge of the Walled City. [...] The moment was applauded by a crowd of invited guests and dignitaries. It was also greeted with shouts of anger from former residents who had gathered for one last, futile protest.""

1038263,Maria,"When one achieves greatness at his or her craft, it’s difficult to walk away when the skills behind it begin to fade. Moreover, facing the hard truth that one’s peak may indeed be irretrievably in the past can be even tougher to accept, no matter how passionate one’s desire might be for it. Such was the anguish that befell Maria Callas (1923-1977) (Angelina Jolie), one of the greatest operatic talents of all time, as she approached the end of her successful but stormy life. Having not performed in nearly four years, with her mental and physical health and singing ability failing, she contemplated a comeback but was torn between taking on the rigors of such an arduous task and living the life of personal contentment she always wanted for herself. It was also a time when she reflected upon her professional accomplishments and personal pursuits, aspects of her past filled with triumphant highs and agony-ridden lows, told through poignant flashbacks shot in stunning black and white. And, as portrayed here, in between these opposing aspects of her life, she veers off into imagined scenarios in which she struggles to distinguish reality from suspected hallucination. In telling this story, director Pablo Larraín provides viewers with a thematically interpretive character study of the grand diva’s storied life, not a by-the-numbers biographical checklist, much like what the filmmaker did in two of his previous releases, “Jackie” (2016) (about First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy) and “Spencer” (2021) (about Princess Diana Spencer), both of which, when combined with this offering, present a trilogy about the lives of three strong, powerful women who lived extraordinary but turbulent lives. What sets this one apart from its predecessors is the career of its protagonist, whose broad range of operatic performances is beautifully captured in an array of sequences. It also showcases Callas’s reputation for being a prima donna but does so without going over the top. In fact, some have criticized the picture for being too subdued in its portrayal of the grand dame. But I personally appreciated the restraint exercised here, an approach that could have easily turned Callas into a caricature. This outcome is largely made possible by the positively stellar Golden Globe and Critics Choice Award-nominated performance of Jolie, who has turned in her best work in years in this offering, a comeback of sorts of her own. Add to this the film’s superb production design, gorgeous cinematography and capable supporting cast, and viewers have an opportunity to witness yet another fine work from an underappreciated director who, in my opinion, is one of the best auteurs in the business these days. Admittedly, the film’s screenplay could have used some work, especially in the depth of its back story, but I’m willing to forgive that in the face of everything else “Maria” has to offer. That’s particularly true in its highly emotive opening and closing sequences, musical montages that are sure to move anyone who doesn’t have ice water running through his or her veins. Indeed, pay no heed to the nitpickers when it comes to this one and savor it for what it’s worth.",8.0
1038263,Maria,"It's no wonder that event cinema thrives when you consider just how impressive it is to hear a full orchestra, some Pucchini or Verdi and the magnificently powerful voice of this eponymous soprano through big screen sound. Of course I could have been doing with a great deal more of her singing, but Pablo Larraín wasn't offering us a ""Now That's What I Call Maria"" compendium. Instead he has teamed up with Angelina Jolie to share this temperamental woman's last week of life in Paris in 1977. She lives in a lavish apartment staffed by her two faithful and loving retainers Bruna (Alba Rohrwacher) and Ferruccio (Pierfrancesco Favino). These two have been with her for many years and are now well used to managing her mood swings, her addiction to medication and to her obsession with moving the piano around with spine-straining regularity. Each day she leaves her apartment bedecked in furs and jewels, strolls the city and ends up in a theatre where she vacillates about singing again - after over four years. I did quite like the technique used to thread the story together, using Kodi Smith-McPhee as her handsome new friend ""Mandrax"" who is conducting a television interview which serves as a conduit for her to reminisce. She has plenty to reminisce about, too, as we mix her childhood in Nazi occupied Greece with her rise to fame before her rather toxic and controlling relationship with Aristotle Onassis (Haluk Bilginer) ends her career. Her staff are so concerned, they recruit the services of a doctor (Vincent Macaigne) who has some stark warnings for a lady who rarely eats and has pills hidden throughout her home, but what's clear from Jolie's quite sensitive performance here is that she isn't a person capable of differentiating between real and make believe any more, and who really just wants to finally live her life - and sing - for herself, regardless of the consequences. It's astonishing that so many people who found fame and fortune in the entertainment industry ended up like Callas, and that rather depressing fait accompli is quite effectively delivered here by a considered effort from a star whose physical resemblance also helped to convince and elicit some sympathy. There are also a couple of then and now voice comparisons for her (and us) to compare and possibly despair over too. The characterisation is shallow, there's no getting away from that - we sort of flit about her life without really getting our teeth into what drove her - up or down, but I suppose it was never intended to be a documentary, more a sympathetic introduction to her beautiful voice, music and tragedy. If you're looking for facts and figures, then this isn't the film, but a superficially effective glimpse of a musical genius - well I can readily give it that.",7.0
1038263,Maria,"<em>'Maria'</em> makes for fascinating viewing. I knew nothing, to be honest, directly of Maria Callas before watching, though obviously had heard of the grand pieces of music. Very sad, if naturally very interesting, to learn more about her and her final days. Beautifully told.

Really intriguing to see that Steven Knight wrote this, not something I'd expect to see him write based on the other work of his that I've seen - more fool me, evidently a man of many talents. Knight and those offscreen are reasons why this is terrific as it is, though the cast are too.

I feel like I've not seen enough of Angelina Jolie. I have seen a fair few films featuring her and have known her name for as long as I can remember, but do sense I've not watched as much as I ought to have done; a bit like George Clooney. Jolie is outstanding here, no doubt about it.

Pierfrancesco Favino and Alba Rohrwacher are also sizeable parts of this, they ensure that the movie holds much heart - I genuinely cared for Ferruccio & Bruna as much as Maria by the end, so credit to them both. Haluk Bilginer and Kodi Smit-McPhee are most noteworthy from the rest.

My only criticism (and it's barely that, if at all) would be that the singing audio isn't the most convincing when paired up with Jolie's lip-synching. It's quite obvious, but then again I guess it is a very tough element to sync up perfectly; especially with such a unique voice.

774531,Young Woman and the Sea,"On the face of it, it's a bit similar to last year's ""Nyad"", only I found this to be a more engaging depiction of the story of a young woman determined to struggle against not just the water, but of the societal limitations put upon her sex and assumed about her potential a mere century ago. As a young child, Trudy Ederle contracts measles. The doctor thinks that nothing can be done, but she has no intention of throwing in the towel yet and decides she'd rather have some cheese than a coffin! This illness is taking place against news of a maritime tragedy that saw many women killed. They were afraid to leave the burning ferry boat because they couldn't swim. Trudy wants to learn to swim, her mother wants her to learn to swim - but her father, an immigrant German butcher, is much more conformist. It's not right for women to swim! Now we get our first indication of the strength of mind of the women in this family as, sure enough, mother (Jeanette Hain) finds her and sister ""Meg"" (Tilda Cobham-Hervey) a women only swimming club run by ""Lottie"" (Sian Clifford) and next, after some seriously punishing training sessions, she (now Daisy Ridley) has her heart set on the Paris Olympiad. History takes over her story now as we follow this hugely inspirational person who sets out to prove that her sex need be no barrier to her abilities and that with the right support around her, she can accomplish just about anything. A combination of Ridley's enthusiastic and exhausting performance and a strong slew of supporting actors make this a genuinely quite poignant piece of cinema. Not only does it address issues of sexual repression, but also of racial and cultural attitudes that needed looking at from both within and without. Stephen Graham turns out well as the savvy coach Burgess and Kim Bidnia also strikes a fine balance between caring, fearing and inspiring as her father Henry. I am not really a fan of Christopher Eccleston, and his overly hammy depiction of Scotsman Jabez Wolffe didn't quite work for me, but this story is built well from the sand up by Joachim Rønning allowing us to feel some of the emotions running through the veins of this groundbreaking athlete and understand just quite why the public at the time cared, too.",7.0
774531,Young Woman and the Sea,"Disney back at it with the great sports biopics!

I remember when I watched all of Disney's main release catalogue of way over 250 movies in 2020 I realised they had produced a tonne of biographical sports/drama films around the 00s... and they, for the most part, were all great movies! <em>'The Greatest Game Ever Played'</em> and <em>'Glory Road'</em> were two of my favourites. They'd all follow a similar formula, yet would each be really entertaining to see unfold.

In recent times they haven't quite made as many and they haven't been quite as grand, though a few were relatively good in fairness; like <em>'Rise'</em> and <em>'Safety'</em>. <em>'Young Woman and the Sea'</em> feels more akin to the earlier mentioned period for this studio with this genre. Joachim Rønning & Co. did a terrific job with this 2024 movie.

The pacing, in particular, stood out to be perfect to me personally. I could feel the movie moving at a nice pace throughout, as one branch of the story ended another began. Funnily enough, the end is where things slow down the most, at least that's how I felt. That isn't a bad thing though, because the conclusion still moves along well and is better in other ways.

Daisy Ridley puts in an excellent showing in the lead role, I've only seen her properly act in that certain beloved franchise so it was pleasant to see her away from that world. Kim Bodnia (also nice to see him elsewhere, I had only seen him in a few Danish flicks), Jeanette Hain and Tilda Cobham-Hervey are pluses.

Away from them, always happy to watch Stephen Graham act, while Christopher Eccleston plays his role strongly - I genuinely felt anger inside me towards his character, so kudos to all involved for making that happen - always a sign of a quality movie if they can do that to the viewer.

This is undoubtedly one of those films that deserves more eyes on it, being on Disney+ it should get them eventually. Highly recommended!",9.0
774531,Young Woman and the Sea,"The extraordinary yet little known true story of Trudy Ederle, the first woman to successfully swim the English Channel, is brought to life in “Young Woman and the Sea,” from director Joachim Rønning. Ederle’s story is one that deserves to be told, and although it’s admittedly not the most interesting, it certainly is inspiring. The film is streaming exclusively on Disney+ just in time for the kickoff of the 2024 Summer Olympics.

Starring Daisy Ridley as Trudy, the movie tells the story of a young girl who overcame adversity after a near-death experience when she had a case of the measles in 1914. Told she could never go in the water or she would go deaf, Trudy became more determined than ever to realize her dream of being an accomplished swimmer. Being told she couldn’t do it didn’t defeat her spirit, of course, because that’s what this movie is about – dreamers.

Despite pushback from a patriarchal society at nearly ever turn and a choir of those telling her she would never find success, Trudy was selected as a member of the Olympic swimming team in 1924 (and won the gold medal). Soon after, her competitive spirit led her to attempt crossing the 21 mile English Channel by swimming from France to England.

It’s a rousing story of a woman born to German immigrant parents in New York City who overcame seemingly insurmountable challenges while pursuing her dream. As you’d expect, the film’s themes of dreaming big, the rewards of perseverance and dedication, and the joy of laughing in the face of those who tell you “no” are not subtle.

The story is filled with positive messaging that’s geared towards young girls in particular, celebrating themes of resilience and empowerment. It’s the kind of film that aligns perfectly with the spirit of the Olympics, offering a patriotic and uplifting story that screams “yay, America!” and “Hooray for Girls!”

The film starts slow and is a bit depressing, but the story eventually takes off. The scenes of Trudy swimming the Channel are repetitive, however, and feel a lot like it’s a copycat version of last year’s “NYAD.”

Still, “Young Woman and the Sea” is a solid story of a remarkable woman and her equally impressive accomplishments. It’s a family-friendly and inspirational biopic of a woman who can serve as a wonderful role model for everyone.

774531,Young Woman and the Sea,"""Young Women and the Sea"" is a recent film that had a brief run in theaters but is now primarily available on Disney+.

The movie follows the inspiring story of a female swimmer who achieves the remarkable feat of becoming the first woman to swim across the English Channel. It is a well-crafted film that delves into historical events with great attention to detail.

Even my 14-year-old son, who typically isn't drawn to historical films, found himself captivated by the narrative. The film is engaging, set in its time period, and boasts impressive performances. The resemblance of the mother to Susan Sarandon was so striking that it kept me on my toes throughout the movie.

With moments of subtle humor and intense scenes like the encounter with jellyfish, the protagonist's journey from a young girl to a formidable athlete is portrayed with authenticity and depth. I highly recommend this film, and believe that Daisy's performance is deserving of an Oscar nomination.",9.0
646683,The Exorcism,"Clearly the Pope wasn't so impressed with Russell's last outing as his exorcist so abandoned the project to some new producers who have decided he might do better as an dissolute actor (""Anthony"") cast to play a priest who is an exorcist. Unbeknown to him, though, we know that the studio set is home to a malevolent spirit - who saw off his predecessor (or perhaps he just volunteered) - and is now determined to cause more mischief. Luckily, director ""Peter"" (Adam Goldberg) has engaged the services of a real priest (David Hyde Pierce) to authenticate the clerical aspects of the film as ""Anthony"" and co-star ""Joe"" (Sam Worthington) find their efforts constantly disrupted by his increasingly vivid dreams, lots of bursting light bulbs and the tiniest bit of Satanic body-bopping. There's really nothing at all to recommend this to anyone. It's not original, nor is it funny. The acting is wooden and it appears to have been written by someone who extensively studied the Janet & John book of dog-collar horror and thought it would make an entertaining film. Neither big name here do themselves any favours, and it ends, weakly, not a moment too soon. Perhaps an October/Halloween release might have served it better, but otherwise this is just a derivatively poor exercise on how the mighty have fallen.",5.0
646683,The Exorcism,"Oh dear, poor Russel Crowe. He's a more than decent actor, so its a shame to see him in a film this uninspiring. 

Washed up alcoholic actor with PTSD (as a result of church based child abuse)  takes on the lead role of priest in an Exorcist horror film, only to become the subject of his own demonic horror.

Its not a great premise to start with not helped at all by its grim back drop of a struggling actor father, with a long suffering daughter, who is forced to adopt a parental role. Its more depressing and sad, than terrifying, adding to the generally leaden vibe, this flick gives off. 

The limited upsides include above average acting and production values, including special effects.

In summary, if you have seen The Omen or The Exorcist, you have effectively already seen what is on offer here, just done a whole lot better.",5.0
646683,The Exorcism,"I didn’t have high expectations for The Exorcism, and my initial confusion about whether it was a sequel to Russell Crowe's other exorcism movie from last year (The Pope's Exorcist, 2023) didn’t help. However, the first two acts of the film were surprisingly intriguing. The atmosphere and the mysteries being built throughout the story captured my interest, creating a sense of foreboding that kept me engaged.

The film does an excellent job of establishing an eerie atmosphere that is both unsettling and captivating. The cinematography and set design contribute to a sense of creeping dread, with dimly lit rooms and shadowy figures that add to the tension. 

Russell Crowe delivers a strong performance as an aging actor who appears to be descending into madness—or possibly possession. His portrayal is nuanced, capturing the uncertainty of a man who doesn’t know if he’s losing his grip on reality or being overtaken by something more sinister. For instance, his interactions with other characters, such as a skeptical priest and a concerned family member, are laced with a growing sense of unease, effectively building the tension. Crowe’s gradual shift from confident to increasingly erratic is one of the film’s highlights.

Unfortunately, the film falls apart in the final act. What had been a carefully constructed narrative devolves into chaos, with the story’s conclusion feeling completely disjointed from what came before. The final scenes abandon the atmospheric tension in favor of over-the-top action and special effects, which undermine the psychological horror that had been so carefully built. 

The ending offers no satisfying resolution because nothing about it makes sense. The carefully crafted mysteries and character development are thrown aside for a conclusion that feels more like a spectacle than a logical progression of the story. This abrupt shift leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, and not in a way that invites thoughtful reflection, but rather in a way that feels frustrating and incomplete.

The Exorcism joins a long line of exorcism films that have missed the mark. While it starts with promise, building an intriguing atmosphere and strong character dynamics, it ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive or satisfying narrative. The final act’s departure from the established tone and story structure highlights the film’s inability to maintain the tension and mystery it initially sets up.

Overall, The Exorcism is a film that had potential but ultimately falters. Russell Crowe’s performance and the initial atmospheric build-up are commendable, but the film’s chaotic and nonsensical final act leaves much to be desired. As another entry in the exorcism genre, it fails to stand out and instead becomes yet another example of a film that starts strong but loses its way, leaving the audience disappointed and disconnected.",2.0
646683,The Exorcism,"The Exorcism is more of a psychological drama than a straight-up horror film, and that’s where it finds its strength. Russell Crowe delivers a compelling performance, and the film’s exploration of addiction, guilt, and redemption gives it emotional weight. However, as a horror movie, it doesn’t quite hit the mark. The scares are minimal, the supernatural elements lack depth, and the finale feels too familiar.

If you’re in the mood for a character-driven story with a sprinkle of horror, The Exorcism is worth a watch. Just don’t expect to be sleeping with the lights on afterward.",
1000866,En fanfare,"“Thibaut” (Benjamin Lavernhe) is an accomplished conductor who is now based in the USA but who comes home to France now and again to perform. It’s during one such visit that he confides to his sister “Rose” (Mathilde Courcol-Rozés) that he needs a bone-marrow transplant. She readily agrees to help out but when she is found to be incompatible, that news opens quite a can of worms that results in him having to ask “Jimmy” (Pierre Lottin) - a brother he didn’t know he had and who lives in a quietly dying town where his workplace is earmarked for closure, to help out. Initially uninterested and disbelieving, the film now illustrates just how the two men come to terms with their past, their present and (hopefully) their future against a backdrop of resentment and privilege as they try to reconcile with the elements of “luck of the draw” that have governed their lives thus far. Fortunately, they have one thing in common. They both love music, and as it transpires that “Jimmy” plays trombone in his local mineworkers band we have a conduit for them to bond - or not! There are shades of “Brassed Off” (1996) as this offers us a social commentary on the decline of traditional rural industries that leave little by way of hope or opportunity in it’s wake; a little bit of romance and some seriously horrible uniforms too! Along the way, there is also some fine classical Mozart, some crooning from Charles Aznavour and some enjoyable band rehearsals with an eclectic collection of the townsfolk proving remarkably talented with instrument and voice alike - after a soupçon of guidance. No, there probably isn’t so much jeopardy about the denouement, though there is a twist - it’s really a story about family and one that’s presented without too much sentiment and a bit of enjoyably bloody-minded Gallic humour. I was never quite sure what an orchestral conductor actually did, standing there flailing his baton at a collection of perfectly proficient musicians, but this might just have helped explain a little - and that seating matters too!",7.0
1155089,Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths Part One,"Way better than the last adaptations to animations, this one adapts the ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"" is a 1985–1986 American comic book crossover storyline that is already a complicated thing into a three-part animation the best way it can (not talking about the TV series).

As with Marvel's multiverse it is the best way to explain all the differences and reboot the mess that DC was in the 80's with several versions of planets and heroes. 

While in the same graphic style (maybe a little better tho) than the last animations, this one was a better written story that compels us to watch and care for the heroes, instead of several of the last freelance animations that were just garbage. 

Barry here feels like a real character indeed.

1102493,Small Things Like These,"<em>'Small Things Like These'</em> is absorbing.

I basically got exactly what I expected from this one. It's a slow burn, quiet film featuring a stellar, if somewhat understated, Cillian Murphy performance. The pacing is spot on and the story is undoubtedly engrossing, it's one that holds plenty of emotion behind it.

It does conclude rather abruptly, I in fact overheard someone nearby remark ""that can't be it"" when the cut to black happens. That isn't, for me anyway, a bad thing though. Again, I kinda anticipated it being a movie that would simply tell its tale and end, which is certainly what it does.

It is very much Murphy that stands out from these 98 minutes, but credit is still due for the likes of Eileen Walsh, Emily Watson and Zara Devlin in their respective supporting roles. No-one onscreen puts a foot wrong. All in all, it's evidently a supremely well made picture - one I'd recommend!",8.0
1102493,Small Things Like These,"A friend of mine used to own a big gay bar in Dublin, and I recall being in it the day that marriage was legalised in Eire. One of the women celebrating was telling us of her childhood at the hands of the nuns in the 1970s. It was a ghastly story of women who hadn't an ounce of compassion between them all, and this film picks up that cudgel and swings it squarely at what it is little better than a religious equivalent of a Dickensian workhouse. The story is told from the perspective of local coal merchant ""Bill"" (Cillian Murphy) who lives with his wife and five daughters in a small town in Co. Wexford. Nobody has much money and some are reduced to gathering wood from the forest floor to heat their homes. By comparison, his family are quite well off and with Christmas looming all are anticipating a good family time. He supplies the local convent-cum-orphanage where the unwed girls of the community are deposited when they get in the family way, and it's here that he encounters a young lass locked in the coal shed. Freezing and terrified, he wonders how she got herself trapped in there - and that's where the story starts to focus on not just the inhumanity that prevailed, but on the internecine, web-like, tendrils of a church that brooked no resistance or interference. If you want a ""peaceable life"" then you'd best leave well alone. Can he, though? He is frequently reminded of his own childhood. One of tragedy, kindness, an hot water bottle and a jigsaw puzzle. ""Bill"" is a troubled man who has much to mull over as his conscience refuses to accept the societal compromises even his wife (Eileen Walsh) might prefer he adopt in the face of what he has now witnessed. This is definitely a less-is-more film, with an effective paucity of dialogue and a sense of oppressiveness that frequently overwhelms with it's simplicity. The setting demonstrates a degree of menace way more poignantly than any horror film, but horror this is - and an illustration of cruelty in it's most devastatingly subtle form. Murphy shines here, his performance allows his character to take us with him as we all observe a scenario unfold that might not have been out of place in 1885 - but in 1985? Not an easy watch, but well worth ninety minutes of your time.",7.0
1102493,Small Things Like These,"When it comes to minimalism in filmmaking, there’s deftly deliberate understatement, which can be a decidedly valuable asset, and then there’s cryptic obfuscation, which frequently leaves viewers scratching their heads. And, when it comes to this fourth feature outing from director Tim Mielants, the line between the two is undeniably and confusingly razor thin, a tale that’s so exceedingly nuanced and purposely restrained that one often wonders exactly what it’s trying to say. Set in 1985, the film tells the story of Bill Furlong (Cillian Murphy), a hard-working Irish coal merchant struggling to make ends meet for his wife (Eileen Walsh) and five daughters. As a soft-spoken, kind-hearted soul, he readily helps others in need, a compassionate streak he developed in childhood when his younger self (Louis Kirwan) and unwed mother, Sara (Agnes O’Casey), were graciously taken in by a wealthy benefactor (Michelle Fairley) when they were summarily ostracized by Sara’s family, a story thread depicted in a series of flashbacks. That quality comes to define Bill’s nature, resurfacing recurringly years later. But its impact becomes most apparent when he makes a coal delivery to the local convent, where he witnesses the infliction of unduly cruel treatment on a pregnant teen (Zara Devlin), one of many such young women who reside at the facility while waiting to give birth. As it turns out, the convent is part of Ireland’s infamous network of Magdalene laundries, facilities run by the Catholic Church where young unwed mothers-to-be were essentially treated like slave labor in exchange for room and board during their pregnancies, a program that operated largely unknown on the Emerald Isle for more than 75 years. And, when Bill meets with the convent’s cold-hearted Mother Superior, Sr. Mary (Emily Watson), about a subsequent incident, he witnesses just how troubling the conditions can get, He’s torn how to respond, too, given the stranglehold that the Church and the convent have over the lives of virtually everyone in the surrounding community. Indeed, what is he to do? From the foregoing summary, this would seem to make for an intriguing movie premise, but virtually every aspect of the film is so willfully downplayed that it barely scratches the surface of this shocking story, one that rocked Ireland and the Church worldwide when it ubiquitously surfaced in the mainstream media. To make matters worse, the film lacks any significant emotional depth, never doing much to draw audiences into the story or the lives of its characters. In large part that’s attributable to the undercooked screenplay and its woeful character development, which is so subdued that little stands out about who these individuals are, with nearly all of the cast (except for Watson, who turns in a superb portrayal) delivering performances that could have easily been phoned in. While it’s certainly commendable that the filmmaker resisted the temptation to sensationalize this story, the finished product nevertheless fails to deliver the goods. (Indeed, for a better, more engaging, more telling treatment of this subject, watch the excellent fact-based drama “Philomena” (2013) instead.) It should go without saying that the victims of this unforgivable fiasco truly deserve better than what’s depicted in this release, and it’s regrettable that they don’t get it, no matter how noble the intentions of this picture’s creators might have been.",6.0

He is now to be an investigator for the state, a stone’s throw from the judiciary, and an important job. He discovers quite quickly, though, that his is really little more than a rubber-stamping position for the prosecutors who are enforcing Iran’s increasingly Draconian laws. His workload is only increased by the evident volume of civil disobedience, and for his own protection he is given a gun. At home, his wife is conscious this new job will heap additional pressure on the family and that it’s more important than ever that they keep their noses clean. Their daughters are going to school and college and are experiencing the horrors inflicted on protestors at first hand. This becomes even more poignant when their friend “Sadaf” (Niousha Akhshi) is caught up with brutal consequences. With “Iman” more disconsolate about the compliant nature of his new job family life becomes strained. Then the gun goes missing. They tear their home apart but no trace. Has he left it somewhere? Has it been stolen? The shame that will be heaped upon him, not to mention the three years in jail, should he not find it. He begins to conclude that the thief must be one of his family, and so resorts to ever more extreme measures to force the culprit to own up. When that takes them all to his home village, things starts to come to an head that tests everyone’s mettle and challenges that which all of them have hitherto cherished. The drama itself is tautly paced and becomes almost visceral as the exasperation and panic sets in amongst parents who realise that nothing is now as it was. It’s also supported by some fairly ghastly UGC from mobile phones depicting the actions of the police as they clamp down on the women who are rebelling against the restrictiveness of what they see as an ever more oppressive theocracy that reduces them to positions of little better than slavery. The plot isn’t without it’s holes, and I found the denouement all a little bit unsatisfactory for a number of reasons, not least what auteur Mohammad Rasoulof allows the character of “Iman” to become, but it’s still a compelling critique of how even the most loving of relationships can come undone when pressure, hatred, fear and mistrust are allowed unfettered into an home that’s embedded within the infrastructure of a corrupt and savagely dogmatic regime.",7.0

Taken as whole, the result is a decent horror/disaster mash up. The characterisations even have some depth, which further adds to the appeal.

In summary, whilst not outstanding Project Silence overcomes the obvious downside, associated with what is, a limited concept by cleverly bringing together enough varied elements, to make this film inherently watchable. Certainly worth a look.",6.0

""Azrael is characterized by the absence of dialogue and a dense visual narrative, challenging viewers to interpret every detail. E. L. Katz's direction, combined with Mart Taniel's captivating cinematography, creates a mysterious, immersive atmosphere, though it doesn't always balance the story's ambiguity with the need for emotional impact.

Nonetheless, Samara Weaving's magnetic performance is the true pillar that holds the movie together, making it a compelling experience with several memorable moments of horror and violence, even if some of its more abstract elements may frustrate part of the audience.

An audacious, artful work with enough entertainment value to satisfy mainstream viewers.""

1029235,Azrael,"Dumb and boring where political message seems more important than a story itself. No explanation what happened or what's going on. All we have is a stupid girl who became John Wick and magically managed to kill whole village without a scratch. Seriously, don't waste your time on this garbage. If you stil decide to watch it anyway, bear in mind there's no speech in this movie. It's a bad copy of ""Quiet Place"" with no plot & bad performance.",3.0
1029235,Azrael,"Azrael is one of those movies where the lead actress carries the whole thing on her shoulders. Samara Weaving absolutely owns her role with such expressive intensity and raw energy that you can’t take your eyes off her. She makes Azrael a character worth rooting for, even when the story doesn’t give her much to work with. Her performance is electric, and she brings so much life to a movie that often feels like it’s just... happening around her.

Visually, the film is stunning. The cinematography and the dark, oppressive atmosphere set the perfect tone for a post-apocalyptic horror. The Burned Ones are terrifying to look at, and the world feels genuinely dangerous. But where it falters is the script. There’s no backstory, no real character buildup, and the lack of explanation for anything, be it the monsters, the cult, or Azrael’s choices, leaves you feeling like you’re grasping at straws to make sense of it all. A little more depth or context would’ve gone a long way in turning this into something truly memorable.

As it stands, Azrael is a chilling, beautifully directed horror movie with flashes of brilliance, but it’s ultimately a missed opportunity. It delivers on mood and style, but it skimps on substance. It’s worth watching for Samara Weaving alone, but don’t expect the story to stick with you in the same way her performance will.",6.0
975511,The Return,"There something about this film that reminded me of “The Mission” (1986) as it simply depicts the rudimentary lives of the people on Ithaca many years after their King Odysseus (Ralph Fiennes) joined the forces of Agamemnon to fight the Trojan War. His wife, Queen Penelope (Juliette Binoche) has been struggling to raise their rather timid son Telemachus (Charlie Plummer) whilst being besieged by a slew of suitors who are convinced her husband is dead and want to marry their way onto the throne. When a man is washed up on the beach after a terrific storm, he is taken in by a friendly pig farmer who nurses him back to health and fills him in on the goings on in this now lawless and largely bankrupt kingdom. It’s pretty clear to us watching who he is, and the remainder of this drama illustrates the struggles of a man conflicted. Certainly, he wants to reclaim what once was his but he is also questioning whether or not he should, or even could, in the face of the scheming Antinous (Marwan Kenzari) who is fairly shamelessly using the safety of her son as leverage to be the one she chooses. Now if you are looking for a sword and sandals adventure, or anything you might have seen Ray Harryhausen animate, then this won’t be for you. It is a much more intense, personal, story of a man coming to terms with the ravages of time and war. There’s next to no sword play, no lions to fight or maidens luring him from to the rocks; indeed this whole story is entirely confined to the concluding phase of Homer’s epic that is solely based on the island. It’s also worth noting that Zeus, Apollo and their Olympian family do not feature at all in this history. It’s all told, bare bones, from the perspective of a character that Fiennes presents well enough, but for my money too theatrically. His less-is-more style coupled with a real paucity of dialogue and Uberto Pasolini’s borderline lethargic direction can make this an almost real-time and sluggish portrayal of an exhausted man, and exhausted population and an even more exhausted wife. On that last point, Binoche has precious little to say for herself throughout and though she looks the part, I didn’t think she was given enough to do to impose herself on the story until the very end, where the thing comes alive for a few moments - but again, in a very stage-bound fashion. The photography and locations do much to authenticate the story, as does the entire production design but given this project was thirty years from first page to first screening, too much objectivity had been lost to the labour of love that this clearly is for Fiennes and Pasolini and though it’s perfectly watchable, it’s just missing that something special.",6.0
829402,Ultraman: Rising,"Ultraman: Rising is a visually stunning animated film that breathes new life into the beloved franchise. I thoroughly enjoyed it, as the film combines spectacular action sequences with heartfelt storytelling.

The vibrant CG animation draws strong inspiration from the Spiderverse films, creating a dynamic visual style that captivated me. The characters are well-developed, particularly Ken, who serves as a relatable model for responsibility and forgiveness. I appreciated how the film balances humor and emotional depth, making it suitable for viewers of all ages.

While the pacing occasionally felt uneven, the overall narrative was engaging and kept me invested in the characters' journeys. The action scenes are exhilarating, showcasing Ultraman's iconic battles in a way that feels fresh and exciting.

Overall, Ultraman: Rising is a fantastic addition to the franchise that successfully combines family-friendly entertainment with sophistication. It left me feeling uplifted and eager for more adventures in this universe.

989662,A Different Man,"""Edward"" (Sebastian Stan) is a facially disfigured man, stuck in a rundown apartment, whose life isn't really going anywhere fast. Then he gets a new neighbour. ""Ingrid"" (Renato Reinsve) is a writer who befriends him and promises him a part in her play. Meantime, his doctors manage to get him on a radical course of treatment that gradually returns his face to a more normal visage. Returning to his flat, and with some fairly grotesque things emerging from his leaky ceiling, he realises that nobody recognises him anymore so he has to assume a different identity. That's when he discovers that ""Ingrid"" is, indeed, putting on a play - and that the old ""Edward"" is the title and the topic. He wants the part. It's his part. How to get it though without giving the game away? Add to his frustrations the arrival of ""Oswald"" (Adam Pearson) who is an ostensibly decent character but who also wants the role, and he has the aesthetics as opposed to the prosthetics. ""Ingrid"" has tough choices to make but where might this leave ""Edward""? There's something quite circular about the way this story pans out. A sort of be careful what you wish for type scenario that gives and removes hope from ""Edward"" and almost creates a villain of the piece too! Is that merited or is that justified? The drama shines a light on the more shallow attitudes amidst society, on our intolerances and assumptions but it also swipes at the fickleness of friendships, fame and success - all rather engagingly delivered by both Stan and Pearson. It's the former man who positively exudes exasperation as the denouement (only vaguely) skirts the Chaplinesque. It's on that note that it's worth saying this is quite funny at times, too - the writing doesn't try to impose any morals on us, rather it presents us with some scenarios and lets us enjoy and evaluate as we go. It doesn't hang about, and right from the start we hit the ground running as the characters develop, the personalities emerge - for good or bad, and it's well worth a couple of hours in a cinema. I got more from it second time round as I was able to focus a little more on the nuance than the imagery.",7.0
989662,A Different Man,"_A Different Man_ delights with a delicious paradox: take a character who feels outcast because of his looks, and then – _voila_. Melt away his differences. _Would he suddenly fit in? Would his life instantly turn around? Or is “success” far more than skin deep?_

New York writer-director Aaron Schimberg wants us to ponder if Edward is better off than he was before. We're caught between wondering if he's a victim of society’s need for normalcy – or a victim of _his own_ victim complex.

With his third feature, Schimberg creates a tantalising fantasy with oodles to say about perception, identity and inner happiness. His dark comic story peers deep into how we deal with “otherness” in society – and how we often revert, in our private moments, to letting our exteriors define who we are inside.

The cherry on top? The scene when Edward’s tumours start loosening, and he literally begins peeling his face off in stringy strips. Whether real or imagined, it’s up there with cinema’s most memorably horrifying special FX.

989662,A Different Man,"Stories that allegorically address themes related to self-esteem, social acceptance and prejudice undoubtedly merit our attention, provided that they execute their narratives in discernable, cogent, relatable ways. Unfortunately, though, that’s where writer-director Aaron Schimberg’s third feature drops the ball. The film follows the strange saga of Edward Lemuel (Sebastian Stan), an aspiring New York actor afflicted with a severe skin disfigurement that has left his face overcome with tumorous growths. However, when he learns of a radical new medical treatment that offers the hope of a cure, he jumps at the chance. And, before long, after a series of incidents that bring graphic new meaning to the term “skin peel,” he’s left with a normal (and quite handsome) appearance. But, now that he has this new look, is it what he really wants for himself? Can he adjust to it and what it affords? This change thus prompts him to ask himself these questions when he starts getting all of the things he had once supposedly longed for, such as a beautiful romantic interest, Ingrid (Renate Reinsve), and a lead role in an off-Broadway play. He can’t help but quietly wonder, “Am I suddenly being accepted because of my appearance or because of who I am as an individual?” What’s more, was the reaction that he previously received from others as bad as he thought it was, or was his perception clouded by his own distorted views of himself? That becomes especially true when he meets Oswald (Adam Pearson), a cheery, well-adjusted individual who leads a successful, fulfilling life despite being affected by the same health condition Edward once had. Conceptually speaking, these issues are universal themes that many of us might ask ourselves from time to time, all of which ultimately stem back to our view of whether we see the glass of life being half full or half empty. However, when examined through this prism, these ideas are unnecessarily muddled here by a clumsy script that can’t make up its mind what kind of movie it wants to be. Is it smart horror? A dark comedy? A psychological thriller? As it’s presented, the film is a jumbled combination of the foregoing punctuated by awkward and abrupt transitions, undercooked character development, and underwhelming explorations of its core notions. Indeed, rather than confidently tackling its primary intents head on, the picture spends much of its time dancing around them (and often tripping over its own feet in the process), particularly with the incorporation of odd, out-of-place plot elements that serve more to confuse the flow of the story than to clarify it. In many ways, the finished product becomes much like the quirky, bombastic works of filmmakers Charlie Kaufman, Ari Aster or Darren Aronofsky, one that leans more toward the needless excesses of “The Substance” (2024) than the graceful eloquence of “The Elephant Man” (1980). To its credit, “A Different Man” frequently comes across better than it probably should thanks to the solid performances of Pearson, Reinsve and Golden Globe Award winner Stan. But, given the film’s many other shortcomings, that’s hardly enough to save this production from itself.",5.0
1214484,Släpp taget,"Don’t leave kiddos around, or they’ll end up eating pizza off the floor.

An impactful ending for a really enjoyable movie. One of those that leaves you with something.",
1129598,Prey,"**_Survival in the Kalahari Desert, physical and spiritual_**

A missionary couple in Africa (Ryan Phillippe and Mena Suvari) are forced to take a flight with a questionable bush pilot (Emile Hirsch). Unfortunately, they & several others end up stuck in the barren areas of Southwest Africa with plenty of lions and hyenas roaming about.

""Prey"" (2024) was originally called “Kalahari,” but changed to the hackneyed “Prey.” The movie poster isn’t that far removed from the 2007 movie “Prey.” At heart, this is a modern take on “Sands of the Kalahari” and “Flight of the Pheonix” with a key element of “Conan the Barbarian” (1982) thrown in. While this is the least of ’em due to its low-budget, it works well enough for a slow-burn survival adventure wherein the gore is more implied than shoved in your face. I prefer it to the 2007 version of “Prey.”

There's a factual error (the medical treatment of a particular wound), as well as a couple of seeming plot holes, but one of them can be easily explained on the grounds that a stray bullet struck the radiator of the jeep. A better explanation is that the jeep wasn't even there since one of the Namibians said something about waiting for the jeep to come back, possibly with another vehicle to transport the prisoners. The other potential plot hole can also be explained with a little imagination. The writer/director isn’t obligated to spell everything out and respects the intelligence of viewers to put the pieces together.

This was the first time I’ve seen Hirsch play a bad boy and he’s convincing. I also liked the lowkey ideological struggle between good and evil, morality vs immorality, faith and atheism (or, at least, agnosticism), Christianity vs secular humanism. Speaking of which, it’s laughable that some people criticize the flick on the grounds of it being “Christian propaganda.” Two of the main characters are occupational missionaries, so it’s understood that God and faith will come up in a few of the dialogues. But, again, this is so light it’s hard to believe anyone would complain. The same came up in “The Grey,” but no one complained there.

As for a weather-related incident that occurs at the end, it doesn’t have to be attributed to a metaphysical source since freak things happen in the weather all the time. The film leaves you thinking about life’s heavy issues, like what’s your purpose? Is there a Creator? Is life a meaningless accident? Is there good and evil -- ethical and unethical -- or is everything relative? Is redemption possible for the morally compromised? Is there such a thing as self-sacrificial love (aka, agape)?      

The movie runs 1 hour, 26 minutes, and was shot in the arid areas of the high country north of Los Angeles, such as SilverStrand Ranch, Castaic; Agua Dulce Movie Ranch; The Quarry in Semi Valley (for the sand sequence); MH Aviation in Lancaster; and Vasquez Rocks; as well as studio stuff done at Blackstone Entertainment, Azusa. A second unit filmed additional scenery and animals in South Africa, along with the use of stock footage.

1129598,Prey,"Could this really be the same Ryan Philippe who was in ""Cruel Intentions""? Are things really that bad? Well now he's ""Andrew"" who runs a Christian missionary deep in the Kalahari. Forced to flee, they engage the rather untrustworthy services of pilot ""Grun"" (Emile Hirsch) and next thing they are amidst some wreckage in the middle of a wild game reserve with loads of hungry lions, hyenas, scorpions and a few heavily armed freedom fighters. Can they survive? There are some beautiful animals featured in this film and the Californian Vasquez Rocks National Park serves well enough as a location double, but the rest of this is all really quite poorly written and executed before a denouement that I could have done with half an hour earlier. There's nothing about the characters for us to care about, one being determined to smuggle artefacts out of the country whilst an other wants to indoctrinate the locals with a lifetime supply of bibles. Maybe he thought it was called ""Pray"" instead? It's not exactly predicable, it's not that structured - it sort of meanders along desperate to generate some sense of menace from it's arid and hostile environment, but all to underwhelming avail. Nope, nothing at all to recommend this to anyone, sorry.",5.0
1051891,Thelma,"According to playwright David Mamet, “Age and treachery will always beat youth and exuberance.” And, if 93-year-old Thelma Post (June Squibb) has anything to say about it in this fact-based action-comedy-drama, you can take that notion to the bank. In this story of a spry but sometimes-gullible widowed retiree living on her own, we watch – often in jaw-dropping awe – a feisty, independently minded senior determined to get her money back when she’s scammed out of her funds in a phone-based phishing scheme. Thelma says nothing about her plan to her family (Fred Hechinger, Parker Posey, Clark Gregg), who are already concerned about her ability to continue living on her own, and recruits the assistance of a wily old friend (Richard Roundtree) to join her in her quest to retrieve the stolen cash. The result is an uproarious farce featuring humor that’s clearly outlandish but never implausible or over the top. But there’s more to this offering than laughs – the sight of capable, underestimated elderly folks taking charge over their lives (and, in the case of this picture, even performing their own stunts!) is truly inspiring. This is backed by a potent, poignant (though never preachy) underlying look at what it’s like to grow old and the losses that come with it, a bittersweet meditation on the inevitable changes that come with age and how all too quickly they arrive, material that’s deftly and often philosophically interwoven with the comedy. Director Josh Margolin’s debut feature represents an impressive premiere for the writer-actor, featuring a superbly penned, well-balanced, evenly paced script relating the experiences of his own 103-year-old grandmother, who’s still alive and kicking and whose real-life home was used as one of the film’s principal movie sets. It’s also a triumph for 94-year-old Squibb in her career’s first-ever lead role, one worthy of Oscar contention that effectively depicts a wide-ranging talent that’s been bottled up for far too long. And the film is a fine showcase for Roundtree in his final feature film performance, one in which we see him in a different light from many of his previous roles and in which he’s perfectly matched with his cunning co-star. My only issue with the picture is with the portrayal of Thelma’s family, in which the development of its three principals never comes off quite right, seemingly reaching for something that doesn’t gel properly, an aspect of the narrative that clearly could have used some further refinement. Otherwise, though, “Thelma” (or “Thelmaf” as it was known in an alternate version of the title) is one of the funniest, best produced releases that I’ve seen in quite some time. So hop on your scooter and get your behind to see this one – or else.",9.0
1051891,Thelma,"Grandma ""Thelma"" (June Squibb) is rather cruelly fleeced by a man pretending that her beloved grandson ""Daniel"" (Fred Hechinger) has been in a car accident with a pregnant women. $10,000 lighter her family realise she's been scammed and she is having none of it. Recruiting her pal ""Ben"" (Richard Roundtree) - or, more accurately, car-napping his mobility scooter, she escapes from the protective custody of her family and sets off to find the culprit. Squibb and Roundtree are obviously having great fun here as the pair embark on an engaging series of geriatric adventures that illustrate, clearly, that though the body may be weak the spirit is very much alive and kicking - and you know you're in for a decent denouement with Malcolm McDowell in the starting line-up too. I thought Hechinger tried a bit too hard here, but there is still something enjoyable about his at times rather theatrical performance and his dynamic with the charming and formidably ingenious Squibb. Clark Gregg and Parker Posey make up the rest of the family and quite entertainingly shine a light on the problems of parents dealing with an elderly relative - about whom they do, genuinely, care, whilst also trying to live their own lives and keep an eye on a son who has, just to make matters slightly worse, recently split from the love of his life. It does have a bit of a wobble for ten minutes towards the end as it struggles a little to make a point about the stupidity of the bloody-minded but for the most part there's a good deal to giggle at as the pair go along. You probably won't recall this for long after you watch it, but it's a good laugh that just confirmed what I've thought for ages. Those buggies need a lane of their own!",7.0
1051891,Thelma,"If it was created with a different set of sensibilities, Thelma could’ve easily been a cheap shot at seniors (and a forgettable experience). Imagine a sitcom-style movie with stale gags about how oldies can lose their marbles, their temper, or their bladder control. A film built around a character that’s there purely to be laughed at.

Instead, we’re laughing with Thelma Post, and at the assumptions and stereotypes about the elder community that she pierces, one by one, and undermines. It’s great writing, brought to life by an ace June Squibb, firing on all cylinders. Together, they create a poignant reminder that even at 93 – perhaps especially at 93 – you’ve earned the right to maintain your independence and dignity. And maybe set off an explosion or two.

807339,Apartment 7A,"The problem with this pretty straightforward reimagining of ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968) is that in the intervening half century, the story has been told and retold to such an extent that this really hasn't much potency any more. Julia Garner's ""Terry"" is a would-be dancer on Broadway who takes quite a terrible tumble that puts her out of action and sees her struggling to find work - or an home. That latter problem is solved when the elderly and kindly ""Castavet"" couple invite her to use an empty apartment in their building - the ""Bamford"". Intent on resurrecting her career, she is pursuing fellow-resident and producer ""Marchand"" (Jim Sturgess) with whom she starts to become romantically entangled. A night she barely recalls then some sudden bouts of sickness leads us all to an inevitable conclusion but something isn't sitting right for ""Terry"". The increasingly claustrophobic atmosphere in the building, the changing attitudes of her hosts ""Minnie"" (Dianne Wiest) and ""Roman"" (Kevin McNally) and a sense that something truly evil is afoot soon sends her into a spiral of paranoiac behaviour that pushes her to the brink! None of the acting is really up to much here nor is the writing and the all-important sense of menace is really quite weakly played out as the whole thing underwhelms. Sure, it's difficult to watch a remake and not anticipate what's going or supposed to happen, but all that really does here is beg the question - why make this at all? Wiest probably takes the acting plaudits - she does exude a certain sense of the downright manipulative, but the rest are going through the motions in a disappointing and procedural fashion. It's all perfectly watchable, but I probably wouldn't bother if I were you - if it ain't broke...",6.0

844185,Unfrosted,"Unfrosted, directed by Jerry Seinfeld, is a mock biopic about the creation of the Pop-Tart that ultimately falls short. While there are quite a few laughs and plenty of absurdity, these elements aren’t enough to save the film from its shortcomings. The film is notably short on story, with a narrative that feels thin and underdeveloped.

The comedy, while occasionally effective, often feels too forced and over-the-top. The film's humor is in-your-face, with jokes and gags that don’t always land. Additionally, the frequent celebrity cameos, while amusing at first, quickly become a distraction. The novelty wears off, leaving the audience to wonder if these appearances are meant to compensate for the lack of a strong story.

Despite its flaws, the film does have its moments. Some of the absurd humor does hit the mark, providing genuine laughs. The performances are generally solid, with the cast embracing the film’s outlandish premise with enthusiasm. This commitment helps to elevate some of the weaker material.

Jerry Seinfeld’s directorial efforts show promise, despite the film’s shortcomings. His unique comedic voice is evident throughout, and his willingness to experiment with the mockumentary format is commendable. 

In conclusion, Unfrosted is an ambitious but ultimately flawed film. While it delivers some laughs and features moments of absurdity that fans of Seinfeld’s humor will appreciate, it falls short in terms of story and overall cohesion. The film’s heavy reliance on celebrity cameos and over-the-top comedy often feels more like a crutch than a strength. However, Jerry Seinfeld's directorial debut shows potential, and it would be interesting to see him tackle another project with a more robust script and narrative structure. For now, Unfrosted serves as a light, if not entirely satisfying, diversion.",5.0

1222248,Nr. 24,"Resistance in the face of tyranny is one of those topics that can make for truly great filmmaking, especially when the subject is timely (as many would contend it is currently). And the latest offering from director John Andreas Andersen serves up an inspiring and engaging tale in that vein. The film follows the experience of Norwegian resistance fighter Gunnar Sønsteby (1918-2012) (Sjur Vatne Brean) in his courageous efforts to take on Nazi invaders who took over his homeland during World War II. Working under the code name Number 24 with a band of longtime friends under the direction of British special forces and the Norwegian government in exile in the UK, Sønsteby coordinated and led an array of raids on German assets in Norway, often at great risk and tremendous personal cost. He also frequently found himself wrestling with his conscience, especially when it came to confronting fellow countrymen who had become Third Reich collaborators, including some individuals he knew personally. Sønsteby’s heroic exploits are presented through a series of flashbacks delivered through a lecture given to students at his alma mater in which his elder self (Erik Hivju) details a variety of these wartime incidents and attempts to answer probing questions from young audience members seeking to understand his motivations and intents in carrying out this mission. The film thus examines the conflicted feelings that he and other peace-loving Norwegians had to contend with at a time when their lives, freedoms and national sovereignty were very much on the line. Andersen does a highly capable job in telling the story of this much-celebrated national hero, even if the narrative is somewhat episodic at times, particularly in picture’s sometimes-meandering opening half hour. Nevertheless, “Number 24” effectively relates an aspect of World War II little known outside of Scandinavia, letting the world know of the bravery of a civil society that rose to the occasion when their liberty and autonomy were threatened in the face of brutal, unrelenting treachery. It’s a lesson we should all take to heart, especially when these conditions loom and place us in a position of vulnerability. Indeed, we should all take heed of the message of this important cautionary tale.",7.0
1043905,Dirty Angels,"Eva Green is in my estimation, a really decent actress, so why on earth is she in whatever this is supposed to be?

""Dirty Angels"" is weighed down by a horribly hammy, pro US story, where allegedly kind old Uncle Sam (the other one who doesn't finance middle eastern extremists), takes on the mean old Middle Eastern terrorists, for the umpteenth time. 

Its entirely predictable fare, with the misogynistic terrorists getting their butts handed to them by the virtuous, if unkempt, female hit squad. 

Action is not well done, its clumsy and feels unbelievable. Characterisations are of the cardboard cut out variety, so no wins there either. 

In summary, I managed about two thirds of this before walking away. Its just not good on any level, squandering some genuine acting talent. What a shame.",4.0

790462,I.S.S.,"There are times when this drama quite effectively illustrates the claustrophobic nature of life aboard the International Space station that is jointly manned by American and Russian scientists. The arrival of ""Foster"" (Ariana DeBose) brings the tally to three from each nation but very shortly afterwards it's apparent that things on Earth are no-good. What look like volcanic eruptions are occurring all over the place followed by complete radio silence. Well, almost complete. The Americans are given an order that they must assume their counterparts have been given too. What now ensues is a really mediocre sci-fi thriller that tries far too hard to manufacture tension from a misfiring cast and some serious over-scripting. DeBose does enough I suppose, but Chris Messina is his usual wooden self (even if there is a scene that just made me think of that famous line from Brian Blessed). The visual effects do enough but the characterisations are shallow and the plausibility of the entire scenario is dubious. Essentially two warring tribes cohabiting the same space-borne igloo. The denouement doesn't really make a great deal of sense, but I suppose it does ask us to test the relative merits of human nature and decency against the demands of national loyalty - especially when the benefits of either are ambiguous at best. It's not terrible, but I've seen better episodes of ""Space 1999"".",6.0

For me, the cast are very solid. It perhaps could've done with a true star performer as no-one stands far and above their co-stars. Ariana DeBose is more than solid, she is the best of those onscreen; albeit narrowly so. Masha Mashkova and Pilou Asbæk are decent, as also are Chris Messina and Costa Ronin.

790462,I.S.S.,"It’s unfortunate that a good premise can’t be saved from poor execution, but such is the case with this undercooked sci-fi thriller. When three Americans and three Russians aboard the International Space Station are stranded there when war breaks out between the two countries on Earth, the previously congenial crewmates turn against one another when the two teams of astronauts each receive orders to take control of the facility at any cost. The question in this, of course, is why? As a scientific research center, what material value would there be in taking charge of a remote space-based facility to the Earth-bound survivors of a war-ravaged planet? While the reasoning behind this is eventually explained, its revelation is delayed, leaving viewers with a drawn-out mystery that doesn’t make much apparent sense, especially when taking control calls for a team of intelligent, convivial, supposedly mature scientists to instantaneously turn into murderous territorial thugs. And, even when the big reveal is finally made, it seems like it’s hardly justification enough for this kind of behavior from a group of individuals who are allegedly more psychologically evolved and have supposedly risen above the infantile geopolitical bickering of their counterparts on terra firma. That’s particularly true in light of the many (and I do mean many) references to the crew’s “enlightened” outlook and assumed solidarity, qualities that are repeatedly browbeaten into viewers in the film’s opening act. The fault here lies with a rather lame narrative and a screenplay that doesn’t do much to overcome that failing. The special effects are also somewhat underwhelming for a sci-fi offering, one in which the filmmakers could have done considerably more to make the picture more visually engaging. Sadly, director Gabriela Cowperthwaite, perhaps best known for the superb documentary “Blackfish” (2013), is in over her head with this release, a project that really could have used a more skillful hand in making it the kind of edge-of-your-seat thriller that it deserved to be. Instead, audiences are left with a mediocre sci-fi tale that feels more like something one would find on the SyFy Channel or some other B-grade cable network. You won’t miss much by skipping this one.",4.0

In this, admittedly the story is all pretty thin, but his characterisation has a friendliness to it that I found quite enjoyable. ""Harold"" is the human manifestation of a fellow who lives quite happily in the land of fiction, but who arrives in the real world to try and find his creator ""the old man"". Together with his more reluctant pal ""Moose"" (Lil Rel Howery) he starts approaching old gents in the park - and yes, well that just causes pain. Then he encounters the young ""Mel"" (Benjamin Bottani) and his mum ""Terry"" (Zooey Deschanel) after she hits him with her car. An overnight at their home sees the start of a rather daft bonding exercise that's completely devoid of jeopardy but thanks to the odd intervention from fantasy-obsessed librarian ""Gary"" (Jermaine Clement) and his straggling pal ""Porcupine"" (Tanya Reynolds) is quite fun. There's an innocence to the whole thing that is quite touchingly simple and honest. People with invisible friends - didn't we all? The animation is perfectly adequate and the purple crayon could teach a 3D printer a thing or two about creating an aeroplane or a car tyre. Sure, it's all forgettable fayre and I'm not too sure if it's in any way sophisticated enough for today's kids - but it's generally quite an entertaining vehicle for a star who looks every inch in his element. It's a summer movie that's as good as any of the more hyped animation's I've seen so far in 2024.",6.0
1196470,Survivre,"Survive is a competently done survivalist, end of the world, action thriller, that feels incomplete. 

This French film has all the right ingredients, a family boating vacation, a sudden, extreme change in the earths oceans and some crime/horror elements, that look promising. Regrettably, whilst this film is superficially, quite watchable, it feels less than satisfying when viewed as a whole. I think the main reason is it doesn't take key aspect of the film's story far enough, for it to amount to anything particularly substantial. 

On the upside the acting is strong, the character development is reasonable if not exceptional, the core premise and setting is creative, plus the special effects are competently done.

Well they do manage to make contact with a nearby diver whose bell was stranded on the sea bed, and he tells them some stuff about the poles being reversed and the water all skedaddling to the far side of the Earth. Maybe go join up with him? Well before that can happen they encounter another survivor, but he's a nasty piece of work and soon the family are reduced in number and having to make their way on foot to find their radio contact before they are crab food. Yep, it's terrible. It's not that it's just entirely implausible from start to finish, it's that the acting is as bad as I've seen in ages and the fact that it is in French ought not to put you off unduly because there is precisely nothing at all in the dialogue that enhances either the film in general or any sense of peril that's distinctly absent throughout the entire ninety minutes.

974036,Ordinary Angels,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/ordinary-angels-review-an-optimistic-true-story/

""Ordinary Angels resonates as a powerful reminder of the human capacity for compassion and collective effort in the face of adversity. The sensitive screenplay by Kelly Fremon Craig and Meg Tilly, along with the stirring performances by Hilary Swank and Alan Ritchson, elevate this true story above the ordinary, offering an inspirational viewing experience that is both a celebration of the human spirit and a call to our inherent goodness.

Despite relying on genre conventions, it stands out for its authenticity and the hopeful message it conveys. It’s, without a doubt, a movie that not only warms the heart of everyone who sees it but also prompts reflection on the transformative impact of generosity, altruism, and mutual care in building a better world.""

Rating: B",7.0
974036,Ordinary Angels,"Hilary Swank turns in quite a strong performance here as Sharon Stevens. She's an hairdresser with a penchant for the bottle - and for denial - who just happens upon a rather sad newspaper article whilst buying her morning six-pack. The headline features the story of the young girl Michelle (Emily Mitchell) who has just lost her mother and whose father is having to come to terms with her own impending liver failure. After many years of medical treatment, the family are over $400,000 in debt and with the vultures closing in on them, she decides to raise some money to help them out. Father Ed (Alan Ritchson) is a proud man. Not stubborn, just determined that he will keep his family and his home together, so he slightly resents Sharon's self-appointment in his affairs. Luckily his mother (Nancy Travis) sees the sense in her activities and together they all work to raise the funds - and sort out the logistics - so they can secure a transplant for the youngster. Swank reminded me of Jane Fonda for much of this drama, and at times her characterisation of a woman with demons of her own is quite effectively annoying as she interferes at will. Ritchson also delivers potently and the young Mitchell evokes a combination of spiritedness and determination that provides this true story is quite a decent validation of just what can be achieved against formidable odds when driven by a can-do attitude, some human decency and an helicopter.",7.0
1103621,หลานม่า,"There are things in life more important than money, but sometimes we lose sight of that, unwittingly allowing our perspectives to become seriously skewed. Unfortunately, this usually happens most often when family-related considerations are involved. And those flawed perceptions, in turn, can become even further distorted when money is tied up with those familial matters, particularly when inheritance concerns loom. Such is the case for a Chinese-Thai family facing the prospects of what will happen to the assets of its terminally ill matriarch (Usha Seamkhum) who has recently been diagnosed with Stage IV intestinal cancer. Several relatives vie for control of her money and property, but the most ambitious among them is her financially strapped grandson (Putthipong Assaratanakul), who suddenly and miraculously manages to shed his generally indifferent attitude toward her and eagerly volunteers to step up as her full-time caretaker, all in hopes that this generous gesture will translate into a sizable windfall upon her passing. However, even though Grandma may be a bit old-fashioned in some of her thinking and outlooks, she’s no naïve dullard, either, quickly recognizing this shift as the transparent move that it is. And she’s determined to have her way about this scenario, using it as an opportunity to not only get her needs met, but also to give her often-lost grandson valuable lessons in tough love and finding much-needed direction in life. So how will this unfold? Will these allegedly altruistic efforts ring true? Moreover, can they be carried out without undue interference from other relatives, most notably his two uncles (Sanya Kunakorn, Pongsatorn Jongwilas), who each have self-serving agendas of their own? And how will Grandma respond to these diverse family dynamics and a host of unforeseen developments that emerge at a time when her health is failing fast? Writer-director Pat Boonnitipat’s debut feature represents an impressive big screen premiere, one that’s thoughtful, sensitive, incisive and touching without becoming schmaltzy, manipulative or overly sentimental. The picture’s finely constructed narrative and superbly written screenplay tell this engaging story with a skilled hand for a first-time filmmaker, yielding a production that’s evenly paced and knows precisely when to employ its dramatic and comedic touches for maximum effect. And, on top of all this, this offering’s gifted ensemble, gorgeous cinematography and suitably atmospheric background score all combine to make the most out of the well-crafted foundation underlying this material. If there’s anything that could use some improvement, it might be in tweaking the picture’s slightly stretched-out closing act, which could have benefitted from some modest editing, but that’s an easily overlooked shortfall in light of all of the film’s other outstanding attributes. “How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies” is truly a cinematic gem that has somehow flown well below the radar thus far, but it’s one of those pictures genuinely worth a look. Thankfully, it’s now widely available for streaming online and truly makes for a worthwhile watch, serving up meaningful observations for those times when we might be on the verge of losing perspective.",9.0
1103621,หลานม่า,"Typically recalcitrant teen “M” (Putthipong Assaratanakul) is puzzled by the behaviour of his cousin “Mui” (Tontawan Tantivejakul) as she meticulously cares for a bedridden, elderly, gentleman. Puzzled, that is, until he dies and leaves her his large home instead of to his children. Almost simultaneously, he goes to visit an ancestral tomb with his own family only for his grandma (Usha Seamkhum) to take a tumble down the mound and hurt her ankle. A routine trip to the hospital delivers some bad news for the family as they discover that she has stage 4 cancer and perhaps just a year to live. Galvanised by the experience of “Mui” and conscious that his own gaming business isn’t exactly setting the cassia on fire, he starts to pay a great deal more attention to this elderly but independently minded lady, in the hope that he might jump up the inheritance ladder ahead of his own mother and her two brothers. One uncle “Soei” (Pongsatorn Jongwilas) is a bit of a thieving wastrel; the other “Kiang” (Sanya Kunakorn) is a successful man living with his wife and young daughter and then there’s his own mum “Sew” (Jear Sarinrat Thomas) who works shifts to keep her and her idler son in reasonable style. Needless to say, “Amah” didn’t come up the river on the last lotus blossom and so is sceptical about her grandson’s newfound familial devotions, but as they share her small (but apparently quite valuable) home, we see their relationship evolve from the obviously venal and suspicious to the more obviously loving. The plot itself does follow some fairly predictable lines, but it’s the two principal characterisations that really work here. The young “M” actually appears to mature in front of us thanks to a solid and often quite humorous performance whilst the wily and spirited grandmother has to face her own mortality and review her own life - often via the disappointing conduits of her children, her grandson and her estranged and wealthy brother. In some ways it reminded me of “Tokyo Story” (1953) in that it depicts attitudes to an elderly parent who is but a fly in the ointment of their own family and professional lives - until, that is, they realise there might be assets to divide. In the end, all the old lady really wants is to see her brood happy and to have that final “home” of her own, but for that she needs 1 million Baht (c.£23k) to secure a spacious plot so her own will come and pay her a visit once a year in remembrance. What’s odd here is that this stoic lady makes a meagre living making congee, has only modest savings in a tin in the kitchen but could never afford to fund her dream without selling her home - yet that isn’t one of the cards she is willing to play. It’s not about her now, but her family’s tomorrow. The gentle intensity of their relationship is really quite touching to watch unfold and this debut effort from Seamkhum is really quite poignant and remarkable. Indeed, when it is just the two of them getting on each other’s nerves; or him buying the wrong fish; or playing cards or even moving the statue of the goddess it’s a lovely insight into an inter-generational rapport that offers both a chance to grow up. Two hours flew by and this is certainly a film you can take quite a lot from to think about afterwards. ",7.0
728949,Nightbitch,"Motherhood – it’s one of those notions that, in the minds of many, is sacrosanct, inviolable and beyond reproach. Or is it? Indeed, isn’t it possible that some women who find themselves in this role aren’t cut out for it and innately regret having taken that step? “How dare they!” intolerant critics might exclaim. However, as this latest offering from writer-director Marielle Heller illustrates, there are those who feel motherhood is a calling they’re not cut out for and may, at best, feel highly ambivalent about. Such is the case of a former artist-turned-stay-at-home-mom (Amy Adams) who clearly loves her young son (Arleigh Patrick Snowden/Emmett James Snowden) but who also finds this role inherently limiting and creatively stifling, leaving her frustrated and unsure what to do. She also feels she doesn’t get the support and understanding that she needs from her husband (Scoot McNairy), prompting her to believe she’s trapped by her circumstances – like an animal. In fact, it’s a sensibility that gradually begins to manifest itself as more than just something out of her imagination, a surreal experience that reveals her “dog-ged” determination to find answers and solutions. Consequently, inexplicable changes in behavior arise that she desperately needs to understand, particularly if she wants to hold on to her sanity and remain a responsible and grounded parent. The protagonist thus launches into an odyssey of exploring the nature of motherhood, a multifaceted, occasionally contradictory exercise whose diverse realizations are often difficult to sort out – and one that’s simultaneously rife with an array of both frightening and inventively comedic possibilities. What’s most impressive about this film, though, is its uncompromising honesty in addressing its subject, an approach that yields a realistically revelatory view of the concept of motherhood, one that (as the protagonist so astutely observes) shows it as being about “more than just sunshine and baby powder.” While it’s true that the narrative sometimes tries to cover a little too much ground and doesn’t always link its assorted observations as effectively or cogently as it might have, it nevertheless uncovers the heartfelt beliefs that some women sincerely hold about being mothers, outlooks that the blinder-clad Pollyannas among us might consider inconceivable or even heretical despite their intrinsic truthfulness and viability. Credit the authenticity behind this the filmmaker and to Adams, who turns in yet another stellar portrayal, one that has already earned her an Independent Spirit Award nomination for best lead performance and could well lead to yet another Oscar nod. Kudos also go out to McNairy, as well as the two young brothers cast in the role of the son, all of whom provide superb support. To be sure, “Nightbitch” may not appeal to everyone, and some could even find it shocking in some regards. But at least the picture doesn’t try to pull any punches, and there’s much to be said for that given the prevailing naïve and unassailable qualities often associated with the idea of what it’s actually like to be a mom.",7.0
728949,Nightbitch,"Amy Adams really does throw herself into this as mother to a young lad whom she looks after whilst her husband (Scoot McNairy) goes to work - frequently for many nights at a time. There's no suggestion of infidelity, but gradually she begins to feel the strains of this relentless young lad's activities. He rarely wants to sleep, is always full of beans and has a penchant for repeating the odd expletive at exactly the wrong time! It's when she starts to notice some unwanted bodily hair, then some seemingly enlarged incisors that she begins to worry if she isn't undergoing some sort of transformation. All of a sudden, dogs start to show a special interest in her and she and their youngster start to play doggy a great deal more... She also finds herself experiencing flash-backs of her own mother and of her erratic behaviour. Might it be something in the genes? It's Adams's performance that stands out here, otherwise it's a really disappointing attempt at an horror story that falls between a multitude of stools. The character - few actually have names - vacillates between adoring mother (and, occasionally, wife) and maniac entertainingly enough for a while but then it becomes repetitive to no end. Sure, she's exhausted with her childcare responsibilities but why is that different to any other parent (not necessarily a mother) when faced with a child keen to explore and prone to tantrums. The marital relationship is presented in an wholly skewed fashion as if poor old Scoot - who was missing large chunks of their son's development - was somehow in clover whist she sacrificed her life and career as the ""home-maker"". In the end, once the humour had subsided, I found this a rather dull rant of a movie that contrived to suggest that this was a woman unique amongst parents, and that motherhood was somehow more visceral than fatherhood. What horror elements there are are entirely undeveloped and by the end I was just a bit bored. I did like the exhibits in her gallery, though - ideal for the Christmas tree, and the young lad (I think there were twins) was the real star of the proceedings.",6.0
1158996,L'Histoire de Souleymane,"Are there times when telling the truth is not necessarily the wisest course to follow in getting what you want? Some might say, somewhat self-righteously, never. However, for those faced with potentially problematic circumstances, that might not be the case. Such is the conundrum faced by Guinean immigrant Souleymane Sangaré (Abou Sangare), who relocates to France to escape the many hardships in his African homeland. He hopes to secure a permanent new home for himself by seeking asylum from Guinean political persecution, a designation that would earn him the protections of French authorities. There’s just one problem with his story: It’s not true. That’s not to suggest that he’s not fleeing many ordeals back home, but there’s no guarantee that they would qualify him to stay in France, no matter how problematic they might be. Hence the asylum ruse, a plan he seeks to perpetrate with the aid of Barry (Alpha Oumar Sow), an expensive (some would say extortionist) social worker/asylum broker playing on (and profiting from) Souleymane’s fears and desperation. Barry supplies his client (like many others with whom he “does business”) with phony asylum documents and an allegedly convincing personal story that he can tell to French authorities during an official interview with a government case worker (Nina Meurisse) to determine his eligibility. While preparing for his meeting with officials, Souleymane works (illegally) as a food delivery courier with the assistance of a shady associate, Emmanuel (Emmanuel Yovanie), who “rents” him fraudulent work credentials that allow him to earn money off the books, a scenario fraught with complications as he bicycles through the streets of Paris. Through this experience, viewers witness the many challenges that immigrants/asylum seekers face when trying to land a new home for themselves far away from their roots. These include numerous bureaucratic nightmares, unbridled prejudice, ubiquitous swindlers, and the frustration of being unable to do virtually anything in addressing difficulties back home, such as handling family health matters and coping with separation from loved ones like Souleymane’s fiancée (Keita Dalo). Writer-director Boris Lojkine’s latest feature outing tells an involving dramatic tale that captured three top honors at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, including the Un Certain Regard Jury Prize, the Un Certain Regard Best Actor Award (Sangare) and the FIPRESCI Prize, among numerous other honors and nominations at other events and awards competitions. This is made possible in large part by the picture’s fine performances, as well as its atmospheric cinematography and skillful film editing, both of which show off sides of the City of Lights not often seen. There’s also a strong degree of authenticity pervading the narrative, bringing an insightful and profound level of credibility to the story. However, these assets aside, there are times when the film focuses a little too much on the setup preparation for the main event (the interview), along with a sometimes-excessive reliance on depictions of Souleymane’s workaday life, while sacrificing greater depth into the protagonist’s character development and back story. More emphasis in these key areas undoubtedly would have added more substance to the finished product, not only giving viewers a more complete picture of its lead, but also likely generating a deeper sense of empathy for his situation.

1186532,The Forge,"#MovieReview #TheForgeMovie

I recently watched the faith-based Christian film, ""The Forge,"" which tells the story of a young man grappling with anger and resentment towards his biological father, as he strives to become a better person without truly understanding how. He is mentored by a group known as the Forge, particularly by a man who offers him a job, portrayed by the talented Cameron Arnett. Arnett's portrayal of this godly figure is truly exceptional, showcasing compassion, emotion, and acting prowess that surpasses any other faith-based film I've seen.

Karen Abercrombie, reprising her role as Miss Clara from ""War Room,"" adds a touch of humor and seriousness to the film. Meanwhile, Priscilla Shirer, also returning from ""War Room,"" solidifies her place as one of my favorite actresses with her captivating presence that draws viewers into worship and belief.

Initially unsure about the main character Isaiah's portrayal, Aspen Kennedy proves himself to be a remarkable actor deserving of praise for his transformation from a troubled young man to a godly figure. The journey he takes viewers on is emotional and engaging, eliciting tears, laughter, and cheers as we witness his growth and struggles.

The supporting cast in ""The Forge"" also deserves recognition for their extraordinary performances that contribute to the film's emotional depth and captivation. Despite being a two-hour movie, the story unfolds seamlessly, leaving audiences cheering at the end for its incredible impact.

I highly recommend watching ""The Forge"" in theaters without delay. This eye-opening experience will resonate with you long after the credits roll, offering a powerful and inspiring story that is truly worth witnessing.",10.0
641934,Am I OK?,"Coming out isn’t always an easy process, especially for anyone who has lingering doubts about his or her sexual orientation. However, given the prevailing conditions present in contemporary society, this gay comedy-drama from directors Stephanie Allynne and Tig Nataro stretches credibility where that notion is concerned. Thirty-two-year-old Angelino Lucy (Dakota Johnson) can’t figure herself out sexually speaking. She’s not particularly interested in men, as her sometimes-male companion, Ben (Whitmer Thomas), finds out, but she’s not sure if she’s genuinely attracted to women. She spends considerable time with her bestie, Jane (Sonoya Mizuno), a straight woman whom she’s known for years but who is also about to relocate from Los Angeles to London for work, a development about which Lucy has mixed feelings. So, when Lucy at last opens up to Jane about her possible lesbian leanings, she does all she can to get her friend a date before she leaves for England. But, somewhat perplexingly, Lucy hesitates at every turn, fearful of what might transpire. And therein lies the problem with this film – it’s just not believable. If this picture were made (or set) 40 years ago, when social acceptance of alternative lifestyles was more problematic, then it would probably come across as more plausible. But, given current conditions, it’s simply not convincing. If Lucy were to live in an isolated conservative small town, it might be more conceivable, but she lives in Los Angeles, for goodness sake, where alternative sexuality is virtually a prerequisite for residency. Lucy’s exaggerated whining about her reluctance to move forward grows tiresome, too, and it’s easy to see why Jane loses patience with her. That’s a problem compounded by Johnson’s underwhelming performance, which is annoying and anything but persuasive. The script’s humor is fairly thin, too, save for the laughs generated in cameo appearances by LGBTQ+ icons like Sean Hayes and Nataro, who delivers a positively hilarious performance as a deadpan New Age retreat facilitator. But the film genuinely could use more of these edgy narrative elements (along with greater overall believability) to succeed as a viable release. In fact, given Nataro’s reputation as a source of outrageously sidesplitting comedy, this project is surprisingly tame and inherently more conventional than what one would expect out of someone so innately talented. The picture’s aptly timed streaming release for Pride Month isn’t at all unexpected, but it’s genuinely unfortunate that this just isn’t a very good movie. Gay cinema has come a long way in recent decades, but this offering feels like an anachronistic throwback to the early days of the genre. We’ve seen stories much like this before, but the LGBTQ+ community deserves something more inventive – and better overall – at this point.",5.0
1045770,Daaaaaalí !,"Biopics are among the most common films being made these days. Some are great, some are decent, and others are more than a little conventional, following rote formats so meticulously that they can turn out shallow or dull. But, when it comes to telling the story of someone wholly unconventional, someone larger than life and the embodiment of surrealistic sensibilities, the tried and true simply won’t work. And that’s certainly the case with enigmatic artist Salvador Dalí, whose unusual paintings nearly always defied description and classification. He was also a shameless self-promoter with an ego the size of the planet and a capricious personality as eccentric as his creations. He often spoke about himself in the third person and spouted statements that required those skilled in the cryptic arts to decipher. So, with a subject like this, a formula biography simply would not work. Fortunately, that’s precisely the thinking that writer-director Quentin Dupieux employed in coming up with this outrageously funny, eminently bizarre offering about a one-of-a-kind individual. In many ways, the film is a cinematic experiment in storytelling, enlivening its narrative in a manner as surreal as one of Dalí’s works. It’s rarely grounded in the straightforward, taking on dream-like qualities with running jokes, repeated but altered sequences and recurring characters that intertwine with one another in unexpected, truly out-there ways. The picture loosely follows the efforts of an aspiring journalist (Anaïs Demoustier) to secure an interview with her subject but who is routinely met with unrealistic, unforeseen obstacles (nearly always whimsically implemented by Dalí himself) in her attempts to pull it off. And, as the movie unfolds, it becomes impossible to follow any sense of reason in trying to figure out what’s going on and where it might be headed (so don’t even try). Instead, just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of it all – the very same attitude that one needs to employ when gazing upon one of the artist’s paintings. This highly fitting approach to telling Dalí’s story works brilliantly, especially coming from a filmmaker who has his own offbeat sensibilities about art, as seen in such prior releases as “Deerskin” (2019) and “Smoking Causes Coughing” 2022). In fact, “Daaaaaalí!” is so quirky and breaks the mold in so many ways that it even features five different actors (Edouard Baer, Jonathan Cohen, Gilles Lellouche, Pio Marmaï and Didier Flamand) portraying the protagonist. And, to his credit, the director thankfully keeps the runtime short at 1:18:00 so as not to overstay his welcome and let the innate joke become tiresome. Still, some might find this a frustrating offering to watch, but, if you’re willing to suspend logic and convention (as you’re clearly supposed to do), you’re likely to find that this hilarious little gem will tickle your funny bone in myriad, unanticipated ways. After all, if the film’s subject defies easy categorization, the last thing a director should do is needlessly confine him to a claustrophobic little box. And, fortunately, that’s exactly the pitfall this release successfully manages to avoid.",8.0

843617,Players,"This film is yet another awkward rom-com with a terrible message throughout. Gender-swapping the roles doesn't make the actions any less creepy, and the story suffers as a result.

The story is fundamentally flawed. Despite the gender swap intended to offer a fresh perspective, it fails to address the inherent problems in the characters' actions. For instance, if a character's behavior is creepy or inappropriate, switching the gender doesn’t change the discomfort it causes. This film illustrates this well, with scenes that feel uncomfortable and forced rather than charming or funny.

The film desperately tries to sell us unlikable characters by casting likable actors, but this strategy falls flat. The characters’ actions and motivations are poorly developed, making it hard for the audience to root for them. 

The narrative is messy and disjointed, lacking a coherent flow. Key plot points are either rushed or dragged out, leaving viewers confused and disengaged. For example, the romantic climax, which should be the film’s highlight, is poorly executed and fails to deliver any emotional impact due to the lack of build-up and character development.

Moreover, the underlying message of the film is problematic. It seems to suggest that certain behaviors are acceptable simply because they are performed by the opposite gender, which is a troubling notion. 

This rom-com fails on multiple levels. Its gender-swapped roles do nothing to mitigate the creepiness of the characters’ actions, and the messy storyline fails to engage. Casting likable actors cannot save a film with fundamentally unlikable characters and a problematic message. This movie is a reminder that superficial changes cannot fix deep-seated narrative issues. For a rom-com to succeed, it needs genuine charm, well-developed characters, and a coherent, thoughtful story—none of which this film provides.",2.0
616446,Brothers,"For whatever reason, genuinely funny comedies have become an increasingly rare cinematic commodity in recent years, so it’s a real treat when one comes along that satisfyingly tickles the funny bone. Such is the case with director Max Barbakow’s third feature effort, the wild and wacky tale of a dysfunctional crime family seeking to recover the hidden loot from a heist carried out by the family matriarch (Jen Landon) 30 years earlier. Leading the charge are twin brothers Jady (Peter Dinklage), a career criminal recently released from prison, and Moke (Josh Brolin), a gifted but long-reluctant thief who’s now trying to go straight. The goal is to find and retrieve a stash of emeralds stolen by their long-absent mother (Glenn Close), who originally pilfered the goods but has been on the run ever since – and who now shows up out of the blue to collect the gems for herself. The unlikely trio thus launches their quest to get the jewels, an odyssey finding them aggressively pursued by Officer Farful (Brendan Fraser), a crooked prison guard who arranged Jady’s early release through his father, a corrupt judge (M. Emmett Walsh in his penultimate screen performance), in exchange for a sizable cut of the stash. And, along the way, the parties to this wayward caper bungle themselves through an array of inventively inspired comic challenges that include Jady’s spacey new girlfriend (Marissa Tomei), Moke’s pregnant wife (Taylour Paige) and an unusually randy gorilla, among others. It’s also a cautionary tale on the notion of there being no honor among thieves, even when they’re members of one’s own family. While some of the film’s segments are obviously a little overwritten and overplayed (especially by Fraser), much of this romp plays fairly well, reminiscent of one of the Coen Brothers’ movies (though admittedly not quite as polished). If nothing else, though, it represents a huge step up from the filmmaker’s last outing, the positively horrendous “Palm Springs” (2020) (my worst film of that year), as well as a major improvement over many of Amazon Prime’s recent disappointing offerings, an accomplishment largely made possible by the performances of its stellar ensemble cast (particularly the three principals). “Brothers” isn’t epic filmmaking by any means, but it’s a good way to get some hearty laughs at home on a Friday night with a big bowl of popcorn, and that’s pretty satisfying all by itself.",7.0

That's the crux of the problem with this - there's virtually no action at all; nothing to remotely scare or unnerve us, just five people about whom I really couldn't have cared less. The direction is chronically slow with loads of pictures of people (luckily dwindling) bobbing about on the water waiting for a rescue that can only come for us once it has come for them... I gather the human body contains a mere 5 litres of blood, well nobody bothered to tell Hayley Easton Street or writer Cat Clarke as that small fact is constantly overlooked!

1028196,Nickel Boys,"The artistic choices a director makes while working on a film often contribute much to the success or failure of the finished project. When these decisions aptly suit the nature of the production, they can transform a commendable picture into a cinematic masterpiece. But, when they fail at this, they can unduly get in the way, and such is the case with this debut narrative feature from writer-director RaMell Ross. Based on the 2020 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Colson Whitehead, the film tells the story of two young Black men, Ellwood (Ethan Herisse) and Turner (Brandon Wilson), who reside at the Nickel Academy, a fictional Florida reform school based on the infamous Dozier School for Boys, an institution known for its notoriously abusive treatment. Set in the 1960s against the backdrop of the Civil Rights Movement, “Nickel Boys” depicts the horrendous atrocities inflicted upon the two friends and other “academy” residents, brutality that included acts of physical and sexual abuse, as well as the mysterious “disappearances” of those who fail to abide by the facility’s strict rules. This is obviously an important and troubling story, one that desperately needs to be told. But, despite the picture’s fictional treatment of a fact-based tale, the impact of the story is severely diluted in this anemic screen adaptation, primarily due to the filmmaker’s attempt at wrongheadedly trying to turn it into some kind of cinematic art project. Much like the director’s inexplicably Oscar-nominated documentary feature “Hale County This Morning, This Evening” (2018), this release is seriously burdened by an array of unsuitable cinematography choices, some of which are employed unevenly, some of which add nothing particularly meaningful and others that are just plain odd. When combined with the picture’s poorly penned screenplay – one rife with redundant, predictable sequences and tediously dull dialogue that tries to pass itself off as more profound than it genuinely is – viewers are left with an overlong, lackluster narrative that significantly waters down the relevance of the events being chronicled here and that could have easily pruned about 30 minutes from its excessive 2:20:00 runtime. In fact, were it not for the fine performance of Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor as Ellwood’s loving grandmother, there’s not much else worth watching in this exercise of style over substance. Indeed, how this offering has managed to capture the attention of the critics’ community is truly beyond me. An incensing tale like this deserves much better than what’s on offer in this disappointing slog, yet another of 2024’s disappointing celluloid failures.",4.0
1028196,Nickel Boys,"There are two really engaging performances on offer here as Ethan Herisse and Brandon Wilson deliver a powerful indictment of a Florida school for boys. Induced there with promises of innovative educational practices and no exorbitant fees, these lads arrive to discover that what they are attending is little better than a prison. Governed by brutality, starvation and violence, the boys have to conform to the demands of their boss “Spencer” (Hamish Linklater) or else life won’t be for the living. It’s worth pointing out that this isn’t just a school for black kids, all shapes and sizes are used and abused here and even if the authorities do decide to make a rudimentary visit, nobody ever dares to step out of line. It’s told using a combination of timelines, so there’s not so much actual jeopardy for the two characters, but what we do see is just how each struggled to come to terms with their predicament in different ways, yet always managing to provide support for the other. As we build to the conclusion, the true extent of the horrors inflicted on these students becomes more appreciable and the production starts to mingle the drama with real-life photography, statistics and more abstract imagery that proves intangibly effective at illustrating just how messed up people could be after a childhood/youth spent in fear. It takes it’s time which at times can prove frustrating, but in the end I reckon RaMell Ross manages to pick his way through this emotional minefield carefully and poignantly and it’s a tough, but worthwhile, watch.",7.0

1120911,Saturday Night,"I think my problem with this was that I remember seeing that opening sketch not long after it was aired in 1975 and it wasn’t funny. That’s kind of what I felt about this whole thing as it in real-time takes us through the ninety minutes before transmission of its creative producer Lorne Michaels (Gabrielle Labelle). The show is nowhere near ready to go, with three hours worth of content slated to fill ninety minutes. His lead talent - George Carlin (Matthew Rhys) thinks the whole thing is rubbish, and John Belushi (Matt Wood) and Chevy Chase (Corey Michael Smith) can’t stand the sight of each other. Meantime, network boss Dave Tebet (Willem Defoe) if menacing about the place with one of those totally supportive faces a football manager gets before he’s fired and the presence of Andy Kaufman (Nicholas Braun), a llama and a pile of bricks doesn’t leave us with much hope it’ll ever make the air, either. What ensues may well have been the very messy, caesarean, birth of an American institution but for those of us elsewhere in the world, this humour is passé and LaBelle’s passing resemblance to Dudley Moore seems to further intensify just how desperate this nation was to get past the scrupulous thought police (Catherine Curtin) who thought a golden shower was something from a Disney movie. It’s designed to bring together just about every form of innovative comedy, and a very extended version of Janis Ian singing “At Seventeen”, to signal a new direction for late night television but that doesn’t make this either particularly entertaining or enlightening. It’s worth a watch, but if this show isn’t already a part of your psyche, then it’s unlikely this effort will change that.",6.0
1155828,Sing Sing,"""G"" (Colman Domingo) spends much of his time in prison leading their amateur dramatics society. This quite disparate group of felons are quite adept at turning their hand to everything from Shakespeare to things he's written himself, and with his clemency hearing looming and him having new evidence that he didn't commit the crime he's in for, he is generally an upbeat and optimistic man. They are one person short on their team, and so decide to approach new arrival Clarence Maclin to see if he will join their group. He does, but he takes a different approach to the whole operation and that looks like it is going to set the two men on a collision course. Their next performance is to be a comedy - but as the story unfolds we find that there isn't so much funny about the various scenarios of the incarcerated characters. There's very little emphasis here on who did what to get behind bars in the first place, the thrust focusses more on the characterisations of the men - many of whom are actually former prisoners themselves, as director Greg Kwedar uses the stage - and, occasionally, the costumes, as the perfect setting to explore the lives of these people. Some of them are hopeful of release, some less so. Some protest their innocence, others - well maybe not so much. Then there's the increasingly potent dynamic between Domingo and Maclin. One assuming he is better placed to help the other, but is that true? Could there be more in common between them than it initially appears? Domingo is on great form, especially towards the end, but it's actually Maclin who delivers the stronger character here. That's doubtless informed by his real experiences, but he still brings a degree of nuance to a role that has little expectation of release nor belief in the rehabilitative powers of the routine day-to-day life in ""Sing Sing"". It's an intense and engaging drama that does draw us in to care what happens whilst creating personalties that are flawed, yes, but not beyond redemption and that are distinctly human.",7.0

1232827,Pigen med nålen,"Having been trained as a journalist, I’m generally not one to back away from an unsettling story, whether told through reporting or on the silver screen. However, there are times when I have to question the wisdom of whether certain films should be made in the first place. Just because it can be done, in my estimation, does not necessarily mean that it should be done. Such is the case with writer-director Magnus von Horn’s third feature outing, a dark, fact-based story that’s innately disturbing and, frankly, pushes the boundaries of good taste. The film, set in Copenhagen as World War I comes to an end, follows the life of Karoline (Vic Carmen Sonne), a factory seamstress whose husband, Peter (Besir Zeciri), was believed killed during the conflict. In his absence, she becomes romantically involved with, and subsequently pregnant by, her boss, Jørgen (Joachim Fjelstrup), who summarily abandons her when his wealthy, controlling mother (Benedikte Hansen) threatens to cut him off financially if they wed. Karoline is thus left with the prospect of becoming an unemployed single mother. She takes drastic steps to end the pregnancy but reconsiders her decision when she meets a seemingly compassionate and supposedly legitimate but highly unscrupulous baby broker, Dagmar (Trine Dyrholm), who offers to help Karoline out of her dilemma – for a price. Little does she know, though, that the cost is far higher than she ever imagined, especially when she becomes involved with the new stranger and her wholly unprincipled operation. What ensues is one of the most troubling stories I have ever seen committed to film, one that genuinely makes me wonder whether it should have ever been told in the first place. Admittedly, this picture is technically well made, with gorgeous black-and-white cinematography and fine performances across the board. However, it’s so cold and unsettling that even viewers with cast-iron stomachs and unflinching cinematic sensibilities may find this one difficult to sit through. Perhaps it may have worked better as a documentary than as a narrative reenactment, but that’s precious little comfort in the face of this offering’s ominous subject matter. It also makes me wonder how so many critics, awards competitions and film festivals have come to lavish so much praise on it, despite the undeniable technical prowess that’s gone into making this picture. Those accomplishments hardly seem to be enough to justify this release’s existence and represent a growing trend toward an inherently unfeeling, irresponsible approach to moviemaking, one whose further development, in my opinion, should be nipped in the bud, no matter how groundbreaking, inventive and provocative it might be seen. Some have tried characterizing “The Girl with the Needle” as a chilling horror film, but, from where I stand, I see it more as a horrific film, a truly dubious distinction to be sure.

Magnus Van Horn's ""The Girl with the Needle"" is a masterclass in period production design and atmospheric storytelling, yet ultimately falls short of its narrative potential.

Set in the bleak landscape of post-World War I Denmark, the film is visually extraordinary. The cinematography and production design meticulously reconstruct a world ravaged by war and social upheaval. Every frame feels authentically gothic - a world of shadows, desperation, and moral ambiguity.

Frederikke Hoffmeier's soundtrack is a haunting character in its own right, amplifying the film's psychological tension. The gothic elements - particularly the morphing faces - are initially striking, though Van Horn's repeated use becomes more stylistic excess than meaningful technique.

The film's technical achievements, however, cannot fully compensate for its narrative shortcomings. Dagmar's courtroom scene, despite strong performance, reveals a script that fails to fully explore the complex moral landscape it attempts to navigate.

1232827,Pigen med nålen,"Just after the end of the Great War, the young and expecting “Karoline” (Vic Carmen Sonne) finds herself alone and with little prospects after confusion around whether her soldier husband is alive or dead reigns and she is swiftly shunned by the family of her lover, the father of her unborn child. Through the grapevine, she learns of “Dagmar” (Trine Dyrholm) who runs a popular sweet shop that doubles up as an adoption agency where people in her predicament may try to find suitable homes for their children. It’s not so much that “Karoline” wants to go down this path, but she is faced with a stark reality that perhaps only her new friend can alleviate. This isn’t just a transaction, though, and gradually the two women begin to bond - to the extent that soon she is also assisting with this illegal enterprise, but is all as benevolent as it might seem? In many ways it has something of the “Vera Drake” (2004) to it, in that it features a very strong leading role for a woman set at a time when the whole process of conception and/or childbirth outside of marriage was seriously frowned upon, and thereby necessitating sometimes quite drastic action from the would-be mothers - only this rapidly becomes something much more sinister. The timeframe also works disturbingly well to illustrate just how straightforward it was following the chaos and destruction of the War to engage in the trafficking of everything from drugs to people - the black market knew few bounds. This is loosely based on a real life story, which only adds to the shock factor as does the setting in a Copenhagen that is anything but the stuff of the “Little Mermaid” and the two leading performances are gritty, poignant and compelling to watch as the story plumbs the frequently odious depths of human nature, addiction and venality. This is not an easy watch, at times you might find yourself looking out of the window or checking your watch, but it’s that authenticity, coupled with an eerily effective score from Frederikke Hoffmeier that creates an atmosphere that wouldn’t look out of place in a “Jack the Ripper” story. By the end the audience is faced with quite a quandary. Sympathy or loathing, empathy or disgust? Maybe all of these, maybe none?

She has returned to her mother's home in Orkney to recover from a fairly torrid time of booze and drugs in London. The timelines are threaded together to drip feed us the causes of her current predicament whilst looking at her own efforts to get - and stay - clean. Of course, there are domestic issues at home too with her father suffering from bi-polar disorder and her mother having turned to religion which add to the turbulence of her life. In the end, she takes a job working on a remote island for the RSPB trying to find an example of the once plentiful but now rare corn crake.

Can she stay the course or is a relapse inevitable? It is a strong effort from Ronan here, and Andrew Dillane also delivers quite effectively as her dad - especially once the film has got up an head of steam and the characters more fully develop. The photography of this sometimes beautiful and other times bleak environment adds really well to the overarching sense of the claustrophobic as the story plays out. Her self-imposed isolation flying in the face of her naturally more gregarious personality.

785542,The Outrun,"The struggle to overcome addiction is indeed a noble one, and it’s been the subject of many fine films over the years. The same is true of movies that explore individual efforts to get one’s life back on track by returning home to one’s roots, both as a way of finding oneself and healing. And, in the latest effort from writer-director Nora Fingscheidt, viewers get some of both of these cinematic motifs, based on the fact-based memoir penned by author and journalist Amy Liptrot. The film follows the odyssey of London-based biologist Rona (Saoirse Ronan), whose wild child tendencies and descent into alcoholism cost her a promising career and a loving relationship with her significant other, Daynin (Paapa Essiedu). But, after successfully undergoing a 12-step program, she decides to return home to the Orkney Islands just off the coast of Scotland to recover and regroup. While there, however, she must confront the ghosts of a past that may have contributed to the development of her substance abuse, most notably dealing with her separated, dysfunctional parents, Annie (Saskia Reeves), a born-again, sometimes-overbearing fundamentalist Christian, and Andrew (Stephen Dillane), a bipolar sheep farmer who has some questionable habits of his own. In telling this story, Rona’s experiences are presented in nonlinear fashion, mixing flashbacks with her period of recovery, a commonly employed approach used in films like this. However, despite Ronan’s phenomenal performance, some truly poetic script writing and the picture’s gorgeous cinematography of the windswept Scottish landscape, the film’s back-and-forth narrative can at times be confusing (and annoying), not to mention repetitive. What’s more, save for some of this story’s unique particulars, the material at times is rather predictable – indeed, almost clichéd -- when it comes to pictures in this genre, offering little in the way of groundbreaking insights. That’s unfortunate, because, with a little fine-tuning in these regards, this could have been one of the year’s better releases. However, as it stands now, the finished product sometimes feels like it gets in its own way, and that’s caused “The Outrun” to be treated more like “The Also-ran” instead of a bona fide awards season contender, one whose strengths, unfortunately, have been generally overlooked or ignored. This is a story that definitely deserved better, and it’s a shame that it didn’t get it.",6.0
1019411,Space Cadet,"I can’t bring myself to say that the wild, goofy, family-friendly comedy “Space Cadet” is actually a good movie, but it does deliver a lot of daffy fun. This one feels like a Disney Channel movie for a slightly older crowd (think 1997’s “RocketMan“ — not the Elton John biopic), but way more over-the-top. It’s absurd, but still mildly enjoyable (especially if your standards are very low).

Rex Simpson (Emma Roberts) is a quirky Florida girl with dreams of being an astronaut. After some creative “doctoring” of her resume and application, Rex lands herself in NASA’s ultra-competitive astronaut training program. This fish out of water has absolutely no business being there, but that doesn’t stop her from using her charm and quick wits to try to fulfill her dream of going to outer space.

The movie is ridiculous, but in a fun way. It doesn’t take itself seriously at all. The jokes, while cheesy, land more often than not. There’s a lot of how is this happening? moments, but it never quite crosses into cringe territory. Most of the credit goes to the charismatic Roberts, who is just so highly watchable. She carries the film with her charm and comedic timing, making even the corniest bits feel fun.

The supporting cast adds to the chaos, with Poppy Liu playing Rex’s best friend, Nadine, who’s equally clueless but super supportive. Gabrielle Union and Tom Hopper are solid as the NASA program directors, but honestly, it’s Roberts who steals the show. She’s so magnetic and funny that you kind of forget how silly the whole thing is.

“Space Cadet” isn’t going to win any awards for its wacky, unpredictable plot or depth, but if you’re looking for a light, funny flick that you can watch with the kids and grandma, it definitely fits the bill. It’s not good, but it’ll do.

1151244,Vermiglio,"Just as too many cooks can ruin the stew, too many story threads can ruin a movie, and that’s very much the case with writer-director Maura Delpero’s fourth feature film. This Golden Globe nominee for Best International Film follows the lives of a family in a village in the Italian Alps in 1944. The family patriarch and town schoolteacher, Cesare (Tommaso Regno), along with his wife and army of eight children shelter a pair of Italian army deserters, hiding them from Axis Forces in search of the runaways. While in seclusion, one of the soldiers, Pietro (Giuseppe Di Domenico), falls in love with Cesare’s eldest daughter, Lucia (Martina Scrinzi), eventually marrying her and fathering a child. However, when the war ends and Pietro travels to Sicily to visit his family, all hell breaks loose, revealing a deep dark secret and creating havoc for his pregnant wife and her family. Had the film stuck to this storyline, “Vermiglio” might have been an engaging watch. But that, unfortunately, is not the case. The picture incorporates an array of other plot lines, seriously diluting the narrative and making for a very unfocused, incoherent watch (particularly in the first hour). Most of these extraneous story arcs remain largely underdeveloped, and much of what could have been done with the principal narrative thrust remains largely unexplored. To make matters worse, the picture’s glacial pacing at the outset tries viewer patience to the point where checking one’s watch becomes a regular activity. Only when the script settles on its primary tangent does the film begin to become remotely watchable, but, by that point (nearly an hour in), it’s too late to salvage the viability of the production, especially since viewer interest in any of these characters has long since evaporated. It’s a shame that the filmmakers chose to employ this approach in telling this story, because, if it had been judiciously pared down to the basics that work best, this could have been a beautiful, compelling release. Instead, we’re left with a mishmash of ideas, themes and narrative elements that leaves audiences clamoring for an end that’s far too long in coming.",4.0
1151244,Vermiglio,"With the war now heading firmly in the favour of the allies, Italian soldiers are deserting in droves and one of them, Sicilian ""Pietro"" (Giuseppe De Domenico) arrives, wounded, in the eponymous Italian village where they know what he has done. Opinion is divided on what to do next, given many have lost their sons in the war or are still ignorant of their whereabouts, but he has the support of the influential schoolmaster ""Graziadei"" (Tommaso Ragno). It's his daughter ""Lucia"" (Martina Scrinzi) to whom he takes a bit of a shine, and she readily reciprocates. They marry and all seems rosy until the war actually ends and he has to return home to his mother. This is when the wheel rather comes off this idyllic scenario as his unanswered letters are eventually explained by answers that rock this tiny village and the whole ""Graziadei"" family. Though the thrust of the story is all rather predictable, the characterisations are poignant, powerful and are cleverly crafted to show us a family dynamic that is not only dealing with the end of the war, but with disease, tragedy, resentment and bitterness amongst eight children who are growing into people in their own right with differing aspirations for education, religion, family and future. Roberta Rovelli features a little less than I'd have liked as the mother of this diverse brood but her nuanced and considered effort as the potato-counting antitheses to her proud and traditionalist husband works well at providing a bedrock for the story. I also quite enjoyed the efforts of the younger children, too. Their curiosity and vibrancy offering us quite an apt tonic to counteract some of the more serious elements as the storyline touches upon issues of betrayal, shame and grief. It's gloriously photographed at altitude and the changing seasons reflect well the blossoming of a family that is certainly not the ""Waltons"". Don't expect it to hit the ground running, nor for there to be any definitive conclusion. This is us observing a year or so in the turbulent lives of a family, a village and a nation and if you just let it wash over you then it's surprisingly affecting.",7.0
1079310,Vingt Dieux,"I watched this for about half an hour before I twigged that “Totone” (Clément Faveau) was Prince Harry’s stunt double! I though the resemblance was uncanny. He is an eighteen year old who works in his dad’s fromagerie when he’s not out on the razz. His dad also likes a glass or two, is lousy at karaoke and not much better at driving, and it’s this toxic combination that leaves the young man having to look after his seven year old sister and grow up pretty swiftly. Knowing as much about cheese making as I do, he is forced to takes a job at a rival farm and that’s where he, and we, discover just his hard it is to make the stuff. Did you know they have to heat the milk to 50°-odd then scoop the stuff out of a vat in less than ten seconds in something that looks like a large brassière? Well he didn’t either, but together with his faithful friends “Jean-Yves” (Mattis Bernard) and “Francis” (Dimitri Baudry) sets about starting his own cottage industry. Thing is, he needs milk. He can’t pay for it, so he decides to purloin it from the neighbouring farm of the sexually curious “Marie-Lise” (Maïwene Barthelemy). It’s a sort of have his cheese and eat it sort of arrangement as he distracts her with nooky whilst his mates help themselves. Of course, this isn’t a sustainable state of affairs for just about anyone, and for the next ninety minutes Louise Courvoisier takes us on a quickly-paced story of human nature and nurture whilst using the rakish “Totone” as an entertaining tool to showcase irresponsibly and selfishness coupled with loyalty and determination. It’s been done on a budget, and some of the production is a bit ropey (especially the edits at times) but there’s a solid cast telling is an engaging story of a community that has it’s own rules of engagement that always requires them to say “holy cow” when astonished, amazed, annoyed - it’s their one size fits all phrase! The on-form Faveau and Barthelemy gel well together, and there is also quite a fun contribution from Luna Garret as the young sister and as feel-good comedies go, this is quite good fun.",7.0

""Self Reliance possesses an intriguing premise but ultimately plays it too safe. More audacity and bite were required to truly leave a mark on Jake Johnson's feature directorial debut.

Good work as an actor - Anna Kendrick steals the show, though - decent showcase of his strengths as a writer - despite failing to fully capitalize on the narrative's potential - but the lack of a firm grip on the thriller elements and some tonal inconsistencies prevent the film from reaching the next level.

1072876,Self Reliance,"I did quite like the premiss here, but the joke really did start to wear a bit thin after half an hour. ""Tommy"" (Jake Johnson) is invited to a secret meeting with two men who offer him the chance of winning $1 million if only he can survive a deadly game for a month. In order to take the prize, he must find a way to stay alive for whilst various hunters try to kill him. His only guarantee of safety is not a church, but being in the close presence of someone else. Innocent civilians are his bullet-proof vest. He assumes he can rely on his family - but they think he's rather lost the plot and that means holing up for thirty days with his nearest and dearest isn't an option. He will have to get out into the real world and make friends. This, of course, leads to new experiences and puts a lot of pressure on this man who isn't really best equipped - for anything, really. What would or wouldn't we do for a life changing sum of money? That's the gist but I found the effort from Johnson just too intense. The humour was way too in your face and his acting over the top as the scenarios began to recycle themselves. There's no jeopardy at all, and it probably didn't help that I'd no idea who Andy Samberg was, either. It's a perfectly watchable vehicle for Johnson if you like your comedy predictable and loud, but otherwise it's all quickly paced but forgettable fayre.",6.0

I understand that in a situation like the one presented here people can do silly things, silly things that will get them killed, but this movie just takes it a step further than it needed to go.

I have a problem with people acting overly stupid in movies and there's just too much of that here.

By the end, you kinda just want most of these characters to die due to how stupid they are and even when it happens, it's not satisfying.

From the time I watched Amaran, I noticed the real emotions put into this movie, but equally Sai Pallavi. The movements through the lens embraced the tidewater essence of Kashmir and sharpened the film’s lovers’ themes of the price of love. They did not make me feel like I was doing something I can usually do with the movies I watch at home or even with the games I play on my PlayStation., but the emotional story of the film kept me glued to my seat.

1154762,His Three Daughters,"Sitting in on a loved one’s death watch can be a trying time in more ways than one can count, circumstances that many of us can probably relate to all too well. It can be an especially stressful, even hostile, experience when incompatible family members are brought together for such an ordeal, one whose duration and developments are impossible to predict. That’s the scenario here faced by three very different (and often-contentious) sisters (Carrie Coon, Elizabeth Olsen, Natasha Lyonne) who begrudgingly join together for the waning days of the life of their father (Jay O. Sanders), who has been placed in home hospice care. During this reluctant, duty-bound “reunion,” tempers routinely flare in confrontations stemming from the rehashing of old, unresolved issues, disagreements about current responsibilities, and the seemingly endless waiting for the inevitable to arrive. These matters all wear on the distraught siblings as they struggle to sort out what’s transpiring and try to arrive at better, more civil understandings of one another. In his latest feature outing, writer-director Azazel Jacobs has created an authentic story about what often occurs under such difficult conditions, astutely blending intense drama, scathing personal interactions, dark humor and hopes for reconciliation against a backdrop of edgy anguish, searing emotional pain and pervasive uncertainty. The picture’s crisp writing and stellar performances (especially Lyonne’s stand-out portrayal) drive the unfolding of this gripping domestic saga, often leaving viewers uncomfortably squirming in their seats as raw, long-repressed feelings surface. To be sure, some of the transition sequences in the narrative could use better refinement to get the overall story on track for what follows, but, then, their handling in this manner could arguably be chalked up to the ubiquitous doubt lingering over this situation, a determination that audience members will have to make for themselves. Still, “His Three Daughters” is indeed one of the better releases of 2024 thus far, one that deserves serious consideration as awards season approaches, particularly in the writing and acting categories. It’s also a powerful cautionary tale for any of us who may be faced with having to undergo a scenario like this at some point, providing us with valuable insight into how we might want to conduct ourselves when these trying times arise.",8.0

The salvation of mankind is going to rest with a generation of hunters. These are rated S-E, with E being the most junior in terms of experience and skill. That's how we meet the young ""Sung Jinwoo"". He's a relative novice who is also broke. He can't even pay the rent, so accepts a task joining a team who are entering a dungeon that's only been deemed safe for ""C"" level hunters. Pretty swiftly he realises that he's being manipulated by his so-called partners and faces an enormous great beastie that looks something like a red-eyed woodlouse. Only by pushing himself to the limit, can he hope to defeat it. This is when he discovers that by levelling up he gains more power, more resilience, weaponry, agility (and becomes considerably better looking!) - and that's the start of a series of well-drawn and lively animations illustrating his increasingly difficult battles to ascend the ranks of hunters earning friends and enmity as he goes. It's quickly paced and more characterful than many of the action animé series, this one, with loads of action right from the start. Though it does inter-twine the fantasy adventures with a bit of the human-side activity, most of this is staged within the confines of a game that presents a range of adventures that are exciting to watch. Jeopardy? Well, no, not really. It's all clearly building to a denouement that isn't going to be included in this amalgamated three-episode feature, but as stepping stones along the way it's also a bit more stand alone than some of the cinematic partial-serialisations that we see. On the downside, it does rely on quite a lot of onscreen textual information that isn't always the easiest to read when fleetingly put onto a big screen, but the escapades with the likes of a deadly red knights and some menacing ice bears help this to flow quite entertainingly.",7.0

This time around I felt character development, is better managed than its predecessor. You get to know secondary characters in more depth and this certainly add's an extra dimension to the tale that unfolds. 

What does not work so well is the incessant oscillating between past and present narratives. Its overdone to the point where the cognitive dissonance is, at times, downright maddening, making following along, more arduous, than its needs to be.

This is ostensibly to make her life happier and more fulfilled, to take the rough edges off disappointment and pain - and generally to turn her into a rather soporific drone. The thing is, whilst plugged in and gently soaking we discover that her brain isn't co-operating with the process and that she is having very lifelike fantasies - historical, contemporary and futuristic with the handsome and enigmatic ""Louis"". The story in itself isn't really up to very much. It's an episodic jaunt through what is/was/might be their lives - together and apart. What does work well is the ambiguity. The sense that artificial intelligence, either working on it's own or at the behest of humanity, can rearrange our thoughts and our memories. It can create as convincingly as it can delete comprehensively - and all because there is a sense that emotions are unpredictable, unreliable and therefore a threat to the stability of a new ""natural order"".

896151,Blitz,"Steve McQueen's _Blitz_ is an incredibly watchable and engaging film that vividly portrays wartime London. Through his lens, McQueen challenges the commonly held notion that Londoners weathered the horrors of the Blitz with unwavering cheer, a stiff upper lip, and unity. Instead, _Blitz_ underscores the complex layers of a city already defined by its diversity, which McQueen portrays as teeming with cultural resilience. In particular, the East End, a refuge for those escaping persecution, is shown not merely as a site of suffering but as a resilient, multicultural community that speaks to the true character of wartime London. This challenge to the rose-tinted ""keep calm and carry on"" narrative is essential, grounding the film in a more inclusive historical reality.

However, _Blitz_ occasionally struggles under the weight of its grandeur. The film ambitiously tackles numerous stories and subplots, making it challenging to give each the attention it deserves. One subplot that particularly suffers is the portrayal of an Underground station flooding after a bomb hit—a moment famously depicted in _Atonement_, with the actual location in Balham. Relocating it to London Bridge heightens the fictionalization of the event. Many may leave the cinema, believing the event that caused the death of 68 people never happened as such McQueen's portrayal, though compelling, doesn't capture the same impact as _Atonement_, which coincidentally also starred Saoirse Ronan.

McQueen briefly gestures toward class disparities in air-raid conditions, notably by referencing the Stepney Communist Party, which pushed for equitable access to safe shelters. Yet one pivotal moment that could have underscored this tension—the Party's dramatic occupation of the Savoy Hotel to protest the gross inequality in shelter conditions—goes unmentioned. This action, poor East Enders storming the grand West End hotel, forced the government's hand to open Tube stations to be used as public shelters.

Meantime, his mum is told of his absconding and as she tries to hold down he job in a munitions factory she must try to track him down. I thought Heffernan delivered really quite engagingly here, as did the rather menacing Kathy Burke with her brief appearances, but the film has a curious sterility to it. We know it's set amidst the random brutality of war, and the narration points out to us that that didn't all come from the skies above with racial prejudice never far from the surface, but it never looks or feels real. Clearly, Apple threw some money at it but the characters are all just too undercooked and there's an inevitability to the story that seems more about convenience than authenticity as it neuters the visceral humanity of the story. That last element isn't helped by a Ronan who seems very much to be going through the motions turning in an adequate enough performance but not one that wasn't being turned in on studio-based television dramas thirty years ago. Dickinson barely features and though it's all perfectly watchable, it's not really very memorable save for a young actor who gives us a knee-high view of man's venality and inhumanity.",6.0

However, when it comes to writer-director Steve McQueen’s take on this event, things come up short on multiple fronts. The film follows the saga of nine-year-old George (Elliott Heffernan), a sensitive but remarkably tough and resilient biracial lad who’s reluctantly evacuated from London to stay with a rural foster family, one of countless children included in a well-organized plan to keep youngsters safe from the impact of the attacks. He’s sent by his single mother, Rita (Saoirse Ronan), a loving munitions factory worker desperate to protect her son. But George is hesitant to leave London without her, and so, while on a train taking him to the English countryside, he leaps from the moving passenger car in an effort to make his way back home. The narrative thus follows his journey to reunite with his mum, who desperately begins searching for him amidst the carnage being wrought from above when she learns of his disappearance. Seemingly, this story should make for a compelling picture, but that’s only true part of the time. This overlong, episodic offering strains to keep viewer interest by inserting the protagonists into repeated perilous situations whose primary aim is simply to keep the story moving forward without much in the way of engendering genuine emotional engagement. While this release ambitiously incorporates stories from the Blitz that may not have received much attention previously, as well as poignant incidents related to race relations in the UK at that time (definite feathers in the film’s cap), these segments nevertheless detract somewhat from the main larger story going on around them, affecting the picture’s overall focus. What’s more, this project is further hampered by issues that frequently bog down this filmmaker’s work, such as the inclusion of extraneous material (resulting in needless padding), segments whose relevance isn’t always readily apparent (especially in transition sequences), a need for judicious film editing and occasionally awkward (and inexplicable) experiments in cinematography. To its credit, “Blitz” is stylistically well made, thanks to its fine period piece production design and impressive special effects, in addition to the capable performances of its ensemble (especially Critics Choice Award nominee Heffernan). But are these assets enough? Not for my taste. Movie fans interested in seeing a better film about the Blitz would be well served by watching director John Boorman’s “Hope and Glory” (1987), a more polished effort that earned five Oscar nominations, including best picture. This is not to suggest this release is an awful effort, but it’s one that, given its subject matter, definitely could have stood to be much better.",6.0
1083658,Scoop,"This film is yet another poor attempt at a Spotlight ripoff, and the primary reason it fails is that it takes itself too seriously. Unlike Spotlight, which focused on the journalism process without turning the journalists into heroes, this movie falls into the trap of hero-worship and overblown ""gotcha"" moments set to the backdrop of the Prince Andrew scandal.

The storytelling in this movie focuses too much on elevating the journalists rather than the story they are uncovering. This approach detracts from the gravity of the subject matter and shifts the focus to the individuals rather than the issue at hand.

The execution of the film is heavy-handed, with a tone that feels preachy and self-important. This undermines the potential impact of the story, as it becomes more about showcasing the journalists as crusaders rather than highlighting the importance of their findings. 

A more effective approach would have been to focus on the investigative process and let the story unfold naturally. By avoiding sensationalism and sticking to a realistic portrayal of journalism, the film could have achieved a more authentic and impactful narrative that could inform a mass audience. 

Overall, this film's attempt to spotlight journalism falls flat due to its overemphasis on heroics and dramatic flair. It misses the mark by failing to capture the essence of journalistic integrity and dedication that films like Spotlight managed so well. By focusing less on glorifying the journalists and more on the meticulous work they do, future films in this genre could avoid the pitfalls seen here and deliver more meaningful and resonant stories.",3.0

1019939,Hundreds of Beavers,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

This film was screened at Fantastic Fest

I attend several major film festivals every year, and it’s always a pleasure to discover a gem that’s hiding somewhere in the cinematic void. Genre film fests are among the most interesting because they showcase independent horror, sci-fi, fantasy, and other avant-garde, eccentric, micro-budget works of art. That’s why director Mike Cheslik‘s “Hundreds of Beavers” was the perfect fit for Fantastic Fest. This black and white game of man vs. beaver is my favorite film that I saw at the festival this year, and it’s not even close.

In what I can only describe as a Looney Tunes cartoon meets Charlie Chaplin meets “Cannibal! The Musical,” this dialogue-free film tells the story of an often-drunk applejack salesman who wants to become the greatest fur trapper in North America. The only way he can reach his goal is to defeat hundreds of beavers in the snow-covered woods. It’s a simple plot, but the humor is on point and the situations our hero finds himself in are absolutely hilarious. Those with a penchant for slapstick will appreciate the whimsy that defines the entire film.

Although this is a silent film with no dialogue, it’s engrossing from the get-go. To make a project like this so interesting takes a different kind of skill from a filmmaking team, and Cheslik along with co-writer Ryland Brickson Cole Tews have an intuitive flair for the farcical and absurd. You’d think the one hour and forty eight minute run time would be excessive, but it doesn’t feel overly long at all. That’s just astounding and is a testament to how strong the storytelling is.

To reveal too many plot points would ruin the surprises because this is a film about discovery in the moment. Even the look of the beavers is hysterical, and when paired with goofy, exaggerated facial expressions and scenes that are reminiscent of Wile E. Coyote chasing the Roadrunner, it’s easy to become engrossed in the absurdity of it all. As the trapper begins to eliminate his furry foes one by one, crude animation registers the beaver kills. His traps become more inventive, clever, and outrageous as he embarks on his quest to annihilate a forest full of beavers.

The film ends with a spectacular sled and snowball chase finale that’s as exciting as it is ridiculous, and the humor drifts between dark and lighthearted with ease. “Hundreds of Beavers” is a true achievement in oddball independent filmmaking, and I am here for every last drop of it.",10.0

1019939,Hundreds of Beavers,"Hunky ""Jean"" (Ryland Tews) has quite a successful little cider business until the pesky beavers manage to destabilise the whole enterprise leaving him homeless with nothing but the clothes he stands up in - and with an hard winter approaching. It's only now that he realises just how much the terrain favours the critters who must now become his prey if he's to survive and not starve to death. The rabbits are no slouches, the fish no fools and the beavers - well they are actually quite brutal as they fell just about every tree they can find to fuel a construction that makes the Aswan dam look like the work of an amateur. Luckily, there is a trader (Doug Mancheski) with a beautiful daughter (Olivia Graves) who will supply all sorts of useful things in return for pelts, so with the help of an expert trapper (Wes Tank) and his carefully drawn map of the lares and snares, off he sets on a series of frequently laugh-out-loud escapades that almost brings the best of Warner Bros. cartoon artistry to life. The comedy is quickly paced slapstick and you can usually see the punchlines from space, but it does work amidst this snowy wilderness where our hero must eat or be eaten. His gradually honed skills see him use a bit of science, grim determination and loads of blind luck to gradually increase his visits to the trader, become better equipped and more loved-up. The title gives us a clue as to what price the man has put on his daughter, and so that's soon the concluding task for ""Jean"" but them toothy-beasts ain't just going to surrender - especially when we do find out what is going on in their industrial-scale complex on the water. It's much too long, though, and at times it's a bit like a board game where we just go round and round (gathering points) rehashing the same old scenarios and jokes, and I felt the last twenty minutes did drag a little - but for the most part it's part Chaplin, part Harold Lloyd with bits of ""Grizzly Adams"" thrown in too. It's entertaining and who knew you could do so much with a beaver's innards...?",7.0
1104844,劇場版ブルーロック -EPISODE 凪-,"""Nagi"" is a bit of a loafer at school. Quite happy to play video games all day only interrupted by the odd nap and food when he absolutely has to. Then he encounters ""Reo"" - a very wealthy boy with purple hair and purple eyes - who sees in him skills that would make him an excellent addition to their football team. ""Nagi"" is completely indifferent to this proposal, but his new friend persists and with promises of becoming the best striking partnership the world has ever seen, he manages to induce just the merest hint of fire in ""Nagi"" - and they become inseparable and unstoppable. This earns them the attention of the Japanese Football Union and both are invited to attended the most competitive football school in the whole nation - the ""Blue Lock"". It's here that the two - along with a few hundred other aspiring young men - must grow up and learn how to win, lose, play in a team - and this tests their friendship as ""Nagi"" starts to emerge from the protective and encouraging umbrella of ""Reo"". Though it's based on a series, this is an enjoyable stand alone film that is quickly paced and written quite poignantly to expose the characters (and us) to some of the difficulties of maturing, making tough choices and getting used to not having everything your own way. At times it's actually quite an emotional animation with plenty to play for and no easy answers.",7.0
1012201,劇場版ハイキュー!! ゴミ捨て場の決戦,"After an astonishing run of success in the Harutaka High School Volleyball championships, ""Karasuno"" school must now face their rivals from ""Nekoma"" and the film depicts, in almost real-time, the ebbs and flows of that game whilst providing us with a narrative of the characters in each team and of their relationships with each other in ""peace time"" - past and present. The animation of the game is lively and at times quite visceral. Each player has their set task within their own team - they must continually evolve their tactics on the court as each pushes the other to new standards, to move quicker or jump higher. One team is much more aggressive and forceful with the ball, the other much more adept at controlling the pace and hopefully frustrating errors from their opponents - and the exhausting dedication required to play as well as the emotional trials faced is well captured as the story reaches it's denouement. It's based on a series I haven't seen, but unlike many of it's contemporaries, this film provides for enough of the backstory via flashback and narration to give us enough information to be able to treat this more as a stand alone story within the confines of the match itself. The style of artwork is very two-dimensional with precious little effort gone into activating the crowd beyond the audio, but the close up nature of the facial and athletic imagery as well as the soundtrack give the thing quite an intensity and show just how team sports can be character-building and to an extent, even life affirming. Tough old game volleyball, too!",7.0

1232493,لا أرض أخرى,"Regardless of your position on the rights and wrongs of this Israeli/Palestinian conflict, there is no other conclusion to draw here but that the ordinary families living on the West Bank are being treated appallingly by the Israeli state. To see little more than adobe one-room houses bulldozed and domestic water pipes sabotaged is little short of outrageous and no wonder the troops were doing their best to stop filming. This documentary focuses on the struggles of Yuval and Basel as they try to prevent the destruction of their community as best they can. Their's is a peaceable fight - they have no guns or rockets, nor do they advocate their use. They just want to get on with their subsistence lives in peace. People can always argue about the legalities of who got there first; who is supposed to have a claim on the land - and whose claim could/should or will take precedent, but for images like this to be seen around the globe is the equivalent of a PR disaster for the Netanyahu government and for it's credentials. Now, of course, this film makes no attempt at balance so what we are shown is very much as intended by the filmmakers, and that's designed to exemplify the attitudes of the settlers - and violent people at times these are too, so yes it can appear a bit one-sided, but when you send a squad of heavily armed troops, tanks and demolition personnel to a village for the sole purpose of destruction - not even of repurposing the buildings - then the moral argument is lost before it's even began. These young guys are sleeping under the stars staring an uncertain future in the face and those who wish to dispossess them clearly couldn't care less about what happens to them, their elderly parents, their young children - even their herds. If you take such an obnoxiously hostile attitude to people, then you cannot be surprised when that transposes itself into sentiment of hatred, rancour and resentment. People have been fighting over this land for millennia, surely it's time for the international community to impose a settlement that respects both communities? Naive? Pipe dream? Well maybe, but so long as the West continues to arm and re-arm the IDF and it's own legal system arbitrarily decides what to do with those of different faiths and heritages, then it isn't hard to wonder just how long these two young  men will remain content to try to use social media and public opinion to alter events, and end up taking more direct means themselves. It's simply put together and all the more potent for that.",7.0
1232493,لا أرض أخرى,"Regardless of how one views the ongoing volatility between Israelis and Hamas in Gaza, there’s another little-known yet equally explosive crisis in the region that has been going on for far longer. This nearly 30-year-old conflict has been quietly but unsettlingly unfolding on the Palestinian Occupied West Bank involving parties not tied to the better-known current conflict, a confrontation that has not received nearly the same level of attention – that is, until the release of this troubling film. Shot over the course of four years, the writing-directorial team of Yuval Abraham, Rachel Szor, Hamdan Ballal and Basel Adra have compiled this shocking documentary about the atrocities that have been relentlessly and mercilessly inflicted upon West Bank Palestinians in the Masafer Yatta region. This collection of approximately 20 small villages was summarily seized by the Israeli government (with the blessing of its courts after a 22-year litigation battle) to develop it as a training ground for tank regiments, an undertaking that has involved the demolition of existing structures and the displacement of the area’s residents, some of whose families had occupied their land for nearly 200 years. Many of those who resisted were forcibly removed, imprisoned or subjected to the heartless, uncompromising wrath of Israeli troops, responses involving bald-faced hatred, severe injury and even death. To make matters worse, the displaced have often had nowhere to go in the wake of these actions, some being forced to live in caves in the adjacent mountains. To be sure, locals have consistently fought back, and some have even attempted to defiantly rebuild the homes and schools they have lost, only to have their hopes dashed by subsequent rounds of sanctioned destruction. It should be noted, as indicated above, that these actions predate the Hamas attacks, so not even retribution can be used as a convenient or “justifiable” excuse for these actions. In light of that, then, can those who profess to be humanitarians realistically call themselves by that name in the wake of an immoral tragedy like this, no matter how much its execution may have been declared legally permissible? Indeed, where is the compassion, the fairness, the justice? This on-the-ground account of events unflinchingly documents this horrific situation, an inexcusable exercise in overreach between the two factions, one that’s impossible to rationalize in the face of vastly uneven odds and especially when the real, previously undisclosed basis behind this land grab is disgracefully revealed. This scathing chronicle, primarily filmed by Palestinian activist Adra and Israeli investigative journalist Abraham, shows the degree of atrocity that has been unleashed in the area, as well as what’s conceivably possible when individuals from two opposing backgrounds begin working cooperatively to expose what’s happening and to concertedly look for a workable solution to stop this inhumane, indefensible madness. “No Other Land” is not an easy watch by any means (sensitive viewers take note), particularly in light of its graphic depictions of violence (some of which, in all honesty, become somewhat repetitive after a while, what some might arguably characterize as overkill). Nevertheless, this Oscar nominee for best documentary feature shines a very bright light on this wholly unacceptable act of barbarity, one that any supposedly civilized society should be completely ashamed of, especially now that the whole world is watching.",7.0

1180629,Kneecap,"Director Rich Peppiatt‘s rowdy, frenzied film “Kneecap” is a lively biopic based on the hell-raising Irish rap trio of the same name. You’ve probably never heard of these musicians, but the film celebrates the general sense of anarchy as these young men become key figures in a civil rights movement to save their mother tongue. It’s a story about finding your voice in a world that seems determined to keep you down, all told with a slew of swear words, hip-hop tracks, and lots of drug-fueled shenanigans.

Set in West Belfast in 2019, the film depicts the origins of the group Kneecap, including insight on how they created their unique sound. In a bid to push back against the establishment, Liam Óg, Naoise Ó Cairealláin, and JJ Ó Dochartaigh (who play themselves in the film) take to the stage as a symbol of Ireland’s restless youth. They refer to themselves as “low life scum,” and their message resonates with so many. By writing and performing hip-hop songs in Irish, they become a local sensation. This garners the attention of their political martyr father (Michael Fassbender), the ire of party conservatives, and the adoration of the people.

It’s a true story that doesn’t give a ton of insight into the band members, but it’s still a lot of fun. The film features plenty of original music by the trio (which admittedly is an acquired taste), and their politically-charged rhymes and defense of their cultural heritage speak volumes. The guys write what they know, and the truth resonates with locals. It comes down to this: when cops don’t want people hearing your music, that’s when you know you’re doing something right.

The songs and the film rapidly switch between English and Irish, so it takes a lot of concentration to watch. I could see some viewers quickly giving up, but those who stick it out will be rewarded.

Liam, JJ, and Naoise are rambunctious lot, and their shenanigans are sometimes questionable but always entertaining. There are quirky bursts of humor that make the boisterous characters even more appealing. None of these guys are great actors, but it adds to the unpolished authenticity of the film.

There’s a defiant energy to “Kneecap” that is invigorating, and the story is one that’s different and original.

1180629,Kneecap,"Two lads with little by way of opportunity hook up with a school music teacher (DJ Próvai) whose wife ""Caitlin"" (Fionnuala Flaherty) is fighting for the legalisation of the Irish Gaelic language. Móglaí Bap and Mo Chara play themselves as two ""low life scum"" who have been taught to weaponise their language by ""Arlo"" (Michael Fassbender) who has decided that it's probably safer for him to die in a fatal accident at sea before the authorities catch up with him. With his ma unwilling to leave the house, Móglaí and his pal start to realise that there is a great deal of power in honestly crafted lyrics that cut through the politics and resonate directly with sections of the population consistently under-represented by mainstream media, radio, music... Thing is, though, the peelers aren't so keen on this subversion and led by ""Ellis"" (Josie Walker) whose niece ""Georgia"" (Jessica Reynolds) just happens to be Mo's on/off sex buddy, are quickly on their case. They've also attracted the attention of some radical republicans who ostensibly don't like the fact that a fair whack of their words relate to horse tranquillisers and other drugs they get sent through the post from abroad disguised as toys and DVDs. With the cops on one side and the fed-up paras on the other, not to mention their third wheel struggling to keep his involvement as under wraps from his school and his missus as he can, these lads don't have their problems to seek. It's unashamedly republican in sentiment and if that's not your position in the scheme of Northern or North of Ireland politics, then this might border on the offensive. It's fairly comprehensively anti-British. However, as these guys get up an head of steam you can't help but like them and want them to succeed in achieving their own sort of freedom from an oppression that is as much to do with their own futures as it has for the broader solution for their homeland. Their writing is ripe and pithy with loads of craic, a little violence but ultimately a message of hope and optimism that exemplifies the old saying about the pen being mightier than the sword - only in this case, it's the rap. It's course and brutal, and won't be for everyone - but you should give it a try.",7.0
1180629,Kneecap,"<em>'Kneecap'</em> is fairly entertaining.

It's impressive how good the acting is given it stars the musical trio in acting debuts as basically themselves. Michael Fassbender adds star power, could've used more of Lalor Roddy (great in <em>'That They May Face the Rising Sun'</em>, fwiw) mind. Other pluses include the camera work and the music; never heard of Kneecap until now, though their stuff is merged in nicely. The humour is amusing too, arguably the movie's strongest element to be honest.

With those positives noted, I didn't find the story all that interesting - and there's a lot of convenience involved for it, as every character has a (too) direct connection to everything else. The main characters are a bit cringe too in moments, though the humour does admittedly just about shield that for much of the run time.

1235499,The Last Showgirl,"There’s something really quite touching about Pamela Anderson’s performance here. She (“Shelley”) is what you might describe as a more refined topless dancer who considers herself more a dancing entertainer, replete with her own body weight in feathers and costume jewellery. She has an estranged daughter “Hannah” (Billie Lourd) and it’s through that strained relationship that we discover a little of just how many sacrifices she has made throughout her life, many that her daughter seems to consider more neglectful than beneficial. To add to her woes, their stage manager “Eddie” (Dave Bautista) announces that playing to ever dwindling audiences has caused their bosses to give them a fortnight before they close. With no good news on her horizon, she has to audition in an entertainment climate that isn’t remotely receptive to her work whilst trying to reconcile with her daughter. Luckily, or not, she has the plentiful advice of her floor-walking barmaid friend “Annette” (Jamie Lee Curtis) who has been in the game for just as long, has a penchant for a margarita and is also pretty down on her luck in an industry where youth is key. It’s Curtis (and Bonnie Tyler) who maybe offers us the most telling sequence of the film as she dances on a table and displays a vulnerability that I think many might feel as they age and feel more redundant - even in a less exposed professional environment. It doesn’t help that they haven’t much to show for their careers, either. This is a film about ageing that Anderson holds together strongly and emotionally and though the substance of the plot might not be the most robust, the two leading acting efforts are powerfully charismatic.",7.0
1235499,The Last Showgirl,"<em>'The Last Showgirl'</em> is good. It's a movie that didn't overstay its welcome, the 89 minutes flew through. Some of the ways the characters act did feel a bit odd to me at times, though the actors all give solid performances; without those onscreen, I'd be rating it lower.

I did hear pre-watch of the positivity Pamela Anderson received for this role and I can see why, she is very good. This is the first time I've seen her in a leading role, despite knowing of her forever. I would, to be honest, put all of her co-stars in the brackets of praise near here though.

Dave Bautista particularly impresses, while Kiernan Shipka, Brenda Song and Jamie Lee Curtis do enough that I do remember them hours after viewing; which isn't always the case for the supporting casts of films that I rate like this. As noted above, it's a film made a success by its talent.",7.0

He's a curious sort of chap who doesn't seem remotely interested in his new charges, indeed he leaves the poor lad splayed on the deck! Next thing, both the girls are in the cargo hold and he (Alex Wraith) has arranged a rendezvous with a physician who has an altogether more sinister intention than they'd hoped for. It turns out these folks have swam into the midst of a people smuggling ring, and they are now $5k per head commodities - dead or alive. It's going to have to be up to the inventive ""Kaya"" to escape and see if she can call for help. Though pretty far-fetched, the story is quite tensely directed for about half an hour as a rather deadly little dimly lit cat and mouse game is played, but the acting is all pretty shocking, matched by some fairly banal dialogue and just a little too much serendipity. That said, though, it's nowhere near as bad as I was expecting when I saw the opening scenes and for a while towards the end it's decently menacing before things flare up nicely. You'll never remember it afterwards, indeed you might actually forget bits of it while you're watching it - but it's not the worst.",5.0

It's quite good fun, this, and I always liked the Chinese depictions of dragons as rather more lithe and nimble then the grumpy, scarred and scaly Western interpretations, but otherwise this is a rather thinly padded out story that might better have tried to incorporate more from this six book series it's based on into it's plot to better build up the characters and fill out the plot. That said, it doesn't hang around and there's plenty of action as the youngster and the ancient dragon ""Long Danzi"" take on the whole Imperial army - and it's dastardly and scheming agent - whilst trying to preserve this fragile blue egg until it's ready to hatch. There's a gentle moral to the story about self reliance and the odd humorous moment too, and though it's probably not a film that the very young will really get much from, the animation is lively and colourful with some menacing bugs and fiery blue fisticuffs and it's worth a watch on the telly if you like the family fantasy genre.",6.0

It turns out that she is a police officer send to lead an investigation of double murder and that he is a captain in the national gendarmerie on a continuing mission to track down missing children - a trail that led him to this ostensibly sleepy hamlet. Reminiscent a little of ""Doctor Sleep"" (2019), the place is overlooked by a sanatorium and quickly the two, initially suspicious of each other, start to realise that their mysterious cases might well be linked. What doesn't really help is a local folklore about the eponymous monster who feeds off the souls of the deceased townsfolk - and as the film gathers pace it seems to be heading for quite a brutal and bloody feast. There might be one really important clue. ""Evan"" (Cameron Bain) who is the survivor of the apparent self-killings of his parents. What did he see? What does he know? Anything? His psychiatrist ""Marbas"" (Sandrine Bonnaire) is determined that her charge be left to recuperate, but ""Franck"" knows he is the link... At times, this is a tensely directed murder mystery but as the plot develops it also rather thins out and neither of the lead characters really offer us much by way of chemistry as serendipity plays just a bit too much of an hand in a denouement that does have quite a fitting twist, but also has something too much of the ""Scooby Do"" about it. It does just about work in a cinema, the wooded landscapes and the eeriness help it out quite a lot, but on television it will be pretty ordinary.",6.0
1084863,Le Mangeur d'âmes,"The Soul Easter walks a, by now, well trodden crime drama path but does little to distinguish itself.

Starting out well enough with an outlandishly gruesome and inexplicable series of crimes, in a sleepy French village, this story builds to a disturbingly predictable and somewhat contextually emaciated, conclusion.

Perhaps ""nothing"" is all the key protagonist is left with but you really do feel a little more is needed, by way of resolution.

Acting is above average but the rather truncated character development, with a pronounced and possibly intentional, remoteness between the main characters, doesn't lend itself to truly sterling performances. 

In summary, this is not a bad film. There's a lot to like, if that's the right word.

What makes these films work is simple fast paced, frenetic action combined with top class choreography. This film certainly has most of these elements but it doesn't work as well. Why? 

Perhaps its biggest short coming is its not especially cohesive. It builds and diffuses its much needed pace.This is not helped at all by  jumping between geographical locations and complicating the team dynamic. 

The main character behaving like a medieval vassal, getting on his knees at one point to beg to keep a case, didn't impress either. Nor does, the at times, rather lame humour,that feels tacked on.

On the upside what remains is moderately entertaining but its not enough to really see this iteration shine.

In summary, not every film in any franchise can be a winner. The Roundup: Punishment is not awful but its not all that good either.",6.0

The chemistry between the kids is definitely fun and charming to witness, but the non-stop profanity, a crazy alcohol-stimulated sequence, and so many other terrible messages for young audiences make this movie one to avoid.""

""Stopmotion stands out as an unforgettable, challenging film, intertwining the art of stop-motion animation with the depth of psychological horror in a narrative as complex as it is disturbing. Although its dense story and unconventional approach are elements distant from the tastes of the general audience, it's a testament to creative power and the exploration of meaningful themes.

The disgusting makeup and repugnant practical effects combined with an equally unsettling sound design, as well as the intriguing study of an artist's obsession and the search for validation, create a truly memorable cinematic experience.

1171634,Quand vient l'automne,"“Michelle” (Hélène Vincent) lives a solitary life in her rural home where she is eagerly anticipating the imminent arrival of her daughter “Valérie” (Ludvine Sagnier) and the apple of her eye, grandson “Lucas” (Garlan Erlos who morphs, uncannily, into the older Paul Beaurepaire). In preparation for this visit, she goes with best friend “Marie-Claude” (Josiane Balasko) to pick mushrooms. This latter lady has problems of her own, with her son “Vincent” (Pierre Lottin) currently incarcerated for a crime we know little about. Anyway, when the family arrive it becomes clear that the mother/daughter relationship isn’t that great - a situation borne from how “Michelle” made her living and of her daughter’s impending divorce and that only worsens when a dodgy mushroom leaves one in hospital and “Michelle” essentially barred from seeing “Lucas”. Meanwhile, “Vincent” gets out of jail so “Michelle” kindly gives him a job managing her extensive garden and that’s when he overhears a conversation between the two women that demonstrates the level of frustrating despair felt by the now estranged grandmother. He decides to see if he can help, with tragic results that end up - well is it a whodunnit or is not? Is it an intricate web of considered scheming or just an accident and some coincidences? It’s that element of uncertainty, coupled with strong performances from just about everyone than makes this story worth watching. There are questions asked that aren’t directly answered, we are encouraged to conclude or assume but given some quite conflicting clues to keep us interested and by the conclusion of the film there’s even the vaguest hint of a winking bromance! The photography and the audio mixing are gently effective and the film, though at times a little repetitive, delivers us a poignant look at loneliness, stigma, loyalty and love.",7.0
927547,പ്രഭയായ് നിനച്ചതെല്ലാം,"""Prabha"" (Kani Kusruti) is a nurse in a busy Mumbai hospital who shares her tiny apartment with the usually skint ""Anu"" (Divya Prabha). We quickly learn that she is married but her husband left her some while ago to work in Germany and she hasn't heard from him in over a year. ""Anu"", on the other hand, has a different emotional problem. She has fallen in love with a young Muslim man ""Shiaz"" (Hridhu Haroon) but knows full well that neither her colleagues nor her family will ever permit such a relationship, let alone any marriage - so perhaps elopement is their only solution. Meantime, whilst these women deal with their own domestic issues, their friend ""Parvaty"" (Chhaya Kadam) is facing eviction from her home as the developers want to move in. Their threats have given way to more practical action as her electricity has been disconnected. In the face of this, she decides it's time to return to her ocean-side village where at least she has her own home. Sympathetic to her plight, the two friends agree to accompany her and it's whilst there that we discover through conversation and flash-backs a little of just how each woman found themselves where they are now, and we take a look at what opportunities might present themselves for their futures. It's a delicately presented story this, set amongst the hustle and bustle of a city that never stops. These women care about others all the time, but are gradually becoming aware that they also have to start caring more about themselves - and for ""Prabha"" who has attracted the interest of the kindly ""Dr. Manoj"" (Azees Nedumangad) she has to decide whether to remain faithful to her past or look to what might be next. There's some solid photography throughout capturing both the lively (and frequently rainy) urban busyness as well as the beauty of the water and the ancient peaceful symbolism carved in the caves, and the whole thrust of the narrative illustrates poignantly the choices (or lack of them) that these women can make in a society where conformity is the order of the day. It can be quite fun at times too, these women are not sackcloth and ashes characters, but there's still a potent message that creates an engaging and characterful study that's well worth a couple of hours.",7.0
927547,പ്രഭയായ് നിനച്ചതെല്ലാം,"_All We Imagine as Light_, a visually delicate exploration of intimacy, displacement, and the quiet search for connection, has earned the prestigious Grand Prix at Cannes. Set in Mumbai, the film follows the lives of three women working in a hospital as they navigate the complexities of their personal lives and fleeting moments of closeness. The film's serene atmosphere, like a gentle breeze, and ethereal cinematography create a meditative mood that resonates deeply with viewers seeking emotional introspection.

Despite its accolades, _All We Imagine as Light_ feels more like a familiar echo than a groundbreaking work. It thrives on its quiet pacing and understated performances but leans heavily on well-trodden narratives. The story explores a short-lived, transformative period in people's lives without providing clear resolutions. While this might appeal to slower, more reflective cinema fans, it risks leaving others feeling they've seen this narrative too many times before. The film's lack of emotional depth can make its drawn-out pace seem unnecessary, leading some to question whether its ambiguous ending is an artistic choice or a narrative flaw.

At times, _All We Imagine as Light_ feels ephemeral—beautiful, yes, but fleeting and ultimately unsatisfying. Exploring a few months in each character's life is compelling, but the film struggles to find new angles on the well-worn theme of the void of human connection.

The performances, though strong, need to elevate the material more to make it stand out as extraordinary. Kani Kusruti, Divya Prabha, and Chhaya Kadam bring authenticity to their roles. Still, their characters don't grow beyond their archetypes—estranged lovers, lonely workers, and outsiders searching for meaning.

Ultimately, _All We Imagine as Light_ is a pleasant but slightly disappointing film. It lingers in the memory, not because it profoundly moves you but because it leaves you wondering if you've seen this story in another movie—perhaps better executed. It's a pleasant watch, offering moments of beauty and introspection, even if it doesn't fully live up to the fanfare.",6.0
927547,പ്രഭയായ് നിനച്ചതെല്ലാം,"Invariably, there’s always one film release each year that’s vastly and inexplicably overrated, both in terms of critical acclaim and awards season recognition, and this disappointing, tediously paced slog tops my list of candidates for 2024. Writer-director Payal Kapadia’s examination of contemporary working class conditions in Mumbai follows the stories of three women who struggle with getting by financially, vocationally and personally, all of them having relocated to the city from their rural roots in search of illusory, overpromised opportunities. The picture has been widely praised for its gentle treatment of its subject, along with its sensitive and nuanced handling of its principals’ lives. To me, however, this is a politely euphemistic way of saying it’s boring (I can’t recall how many times I checked my watch during the screening I attended). Moreover, this offering tries unsuccessfully to cover too much ground (and not very well at that), including an array of topics ranging from loneliness to fiscal hardship to gentrification to outmoded traditions and more. I also don’t find this offering to be especially groundbreaking in terms of its subject matter; its themes of working class struggles and personal isolation, in my estimation, are addressed far more effectively in other Indian films like “The Lunchbox” (2013) and “Fire in the Mountains” (2021), which present more compelling and more engaging treatments of their stories (watch those pictures instead). On top of all this, there are some narrative elements that don’t feel sufficiently fleshed out or that are either implausible or woefully executed surrealistically (it’s subtlety often makes it hard to tell which is truly the case). Admittedly, the film’s aesthetics, such as its cinematography, have much going for them, but they’re not nearly enough to make up for the picture’s larger and more significant shortcomings. At the risk of being ridiculed, I truly don’t believe “All We Imagine as Light” is rightfully worthy of the many accolades it has received from the Golden Globe Awards, the Critics Choice Awards, the Independent Spirit Awards, the National Board of Review, and the Cannes and Chicago Film Festivals, among others. With so many other (and better) international film offerings out there, it’s regrettable that these competitions and festivals have squandered nominations and awards on this needlessly hyped undercooked release.",4.0

""Turtles All the Way Down stands out as a complex, engaging, thematically rich story of self-discovery.

Through the convincing performances of the cast, Hannah Marks offers an authentic, immersive portrayal of the daily struggles of those suffering from OCD, and although it fails to overcome structural predictability and the less convincing development of the main romance, it conveys important lessons about this particular disorder, as well as about mental health and human relationships.

A balance of entertainment and reflection that I recommend to viewers seeking a touching, educational home cinema session.""

574451,Turtles All the Way Down,"While _Turtles All the Way Down_ deals with serious issues like grief and the toll of mental illness, Hannah Marks imbues the movie with such color and humor that the highs and lows feel even more powerful.

_Turtles All the Way Down_ tells a moving story about a teenager's isolating struggle with mental illness, and her resolve to build a life for herself despite it.

The entire cast of _Turtles All the Way Down_ brings something distinct and wonderful to the movie. However, Isabela Merced's performance as Aza will likely go down in the books as one of the most impressive of her career.

The chemistry between Merced and Cree as Aza and Daisy is perhaps the film's greatest strength — and certainly its greatest love story. Their effortless comedy and obvious care for one another make the friendship feel totally believable, and it makes their fights all the more devastating.",
916728,Slingshot,"Sci-fi releases that attempt to do something more than the minimum of what’s typically expected of them are to be admired for their ambition and creativity. That’s especially true when they seek to fuse their subjects and storylines with material drawn from other genres. However, to achieve success at that, the filmmakers behind these projects need to be very precise and diligent in coming up with a mix that works, and, sadly, that’s where this offering fails – not by much, mind you, but just enough to characterize it as a well-intentioned near miss. The film follows the diverse, often-surreal experiences of an astronaut (Casey Affleck) on a daring, cutting-edge mission to the Saturnian moon Titan, one that’s to be reached via a gravitational slingshot effect around Jupiter that will propel the craft to its destination at an accelerated speed. That consideration aside, though, the journey is nevertheless a lengthy one, requiring the protagonist and his crew mates (Laurence Fishburne, Tomer Capone) to be placed in drug-induced hibernation for vast stretches of the trip, a tricky proposition given the potential side effects of these powerful substances. This blend of story elements thus sets up the characters for an odyssey (ironically, the name of their ship) fraught with strange dreams, hallucinations and other unexpected developments, particularly when the spacecraft is mysteriously damaged, placing completion of the mission in jeopardy and affecting the psychological stability of the crew. Matters become further complicated when our hero begins having visions of his romantic interest (and one of the ship’s designers) (Emily Beecham) aboard the craft. So what is exactly going on here? That’s what director Mikael Hafstrom seeks to explain, though it’s far from an easy task. While the picture has its moments of intelligence and even poetic insights, it nevertheless struggles with a narrative and screenplay that become a little too convoluted for their own good. The writing, unfortunately, isn’t completely capable of fulfilling its intent, often taking the long way around to connect the dots and involving material that could have used some cleaning up to attain its goal (such as (ironically enough) using some “slingshot” shortcuts to move the story along instead of getting bogged down in plodding, elaborate attempts at explanation). Some will also note the many thematic similarities between this offering and “Spaceman,” released earlier this year (though, admittedly, there are enough distinct tonal differences and plot devices to adequately distinguish the two films and keep them from being labeled copycats). And then rhere’s the production’s tendency to push the limits of appropriate on-screen violence, verging on becoming a little too gratuitous though never actually crossing the line of acceptability (despite coming precariously close on occasion). Regrettably, these shortcomings detract somewhat from some of the picture’s genuinely fine attributes, such as some gorgeous special effects, a simple but smart production design, solid performances and a catchy soundtrack. It’s truly a shame that those elements noted above don’t match the level of these qualities; had “Slingshot” done so, this would have been a stellar release in the same vein as offerings like “Solaris” (2002) and “2001: A Space Odyssey” (1968) instead of becoming a largely forgettable sci-fi also-ran, a destiny with which it’s ultimately likely to be saddled.",5.0
916728,Slingshot,"In the mesmerizing thriller ""Slingshot,"" viewers are taken on a gripping journey through the vast expanse of space and time. Casey Affleck stars as John, a character who finds himself trapped in the depths of space, leading to a series of unexpected twists and turns that keep audiences on the edge of their seats.

While the film may have moments that captivate and intrigue, there are also instances where the pace slows and boredom may creep in. However, as the third act unfolds, the movie truly takes flight, delivering an exhilarating and unforgettable experience that makes the initial dryness worth enduring.

Throughout the film, viewers are kept guessing and questioning the fates of characters like John, Nash, and Frank, creating a sense of anticipation and curiosity that drives the narrative forward. Lawrence Fishburne shines as the formidable antagonist, bringing a menacing intensity to his role that adds depth to the story. Meanwhile, Casey Affleck delivers a standout performance that solidifies his place as a talented actor.

1032425,The Dead Don't Hurt,"Despite the fact that the plot has plenty of holes, this western just about works. It's all about the determined ""Vivienne"" (Vicky Krieps), very much a woman in a man's world of pioneering in the 1860s. She encounters the honest and thoughtful ""Olsen"" (Viggo Mortensen) and travels to his remote, and rather ramshackle, shack where they begin to make an home for themselves. He takes a job as their sheriff and she, a little to his chagrin, starts working in the saloon. He is restless, though, and with the American civil war looming large, he decides that he ought to use his Danish army training and go enlist. She's not enamoured of the idea, but off he goes and that leaves her alone and firmly in the sights of spoilt local ""Weston"" (the rather un-menacing Solly McLeod). When ""Olsen"" returns from the war quite a few years later he is presented with a few shocks! Subsequent events take an even more tragic turn, and now he must face his demons and settle accounts. This is a grand looking romantic drama that takes it's time to get going and that allows Krieps to invest strongly in the maturing elements of her character. That he would just saunter off for years and leave her alone and unprotected does beggar belief a bit, and there's no denying that does negatively impact on the plausibility of what, rather obviously, comes next. Still, there is enough meat on the bones of the story, an effectively sparing amount of dialogue and a soupçon of chemistry between the two at the top of the cast that gives some indication of just how tough and lawless life was and at how difficult it was to be decent!",7.0

Vicky Krieps does her best and is probably the movie's standout. I do like Garret Dillahunt, albeit from other performances from his career - which seems to be seeing him typecast in these sorta roles, which is a bit of a shame.

1128559,Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story,"Unlike many retrospectives of late lamented actors, this film has a much greater degree of honesty from it's contributors as it takes a look back at the life of the man most famous for darting about in a blue cape saving the world from Gene Hackman and Terence Stamp. It also benefits from being about a man and his family whose lives have been captured to quite an extent by home movies that illustrate the joyous, and heinous, moments as he rose to fame then struggled to come to terms with his life-altering accident. What we are given here is a frank portrayal of an actor - maybe not the most versatile, it has to be said - who tread the boards off, off-Broadway before lucking out at the audition in London the made him an household name. The principal narrative is provided by those closest to him - his long-term ex-girlfriend Gae Exton, the mother of their children Matt and Ali and by Will, his son with Reeve's profoundly stoical and steadfast wife Dana. There is also some insight from Jeff Daniels, Whoopi Goldberg and Glenn Close - and there is an interesting degree of frankness from these people that also touches on issues faced by some of their mutual friends. Though sympathetic and celebratory, these comments are not entirely adulatory. Indeed, his elder son offers us some thinly veiled criticism of a man who maybe didn't focus as he could have on his first family, and who had a reputation as a bit of a rake at times, too. The documentary quite successfully uses more archive to demonstrate this family's determination after his paralysis to do what could be done to raise awareness and funds to improve treatment and support for others. Apparently some 4 million Americans have some sort of disability and in trying to address this, he demonstrates the power of celebrity to stretch far beyond symbolism proving that political connections, pressure and principle can make a profound difference to situations that many would sooner sweep under the carpet. It's not always easy to watch - but then neither were many of his films - but it does make it's point effectively, avoids sentimentality for the most part, and tells us a story of a flawed man whose sheer willpower and charisma helped create a testament the others may still be befitting from decades later.",7.0
1128559,Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story,"“Hero” is a revered term that, regrettably, is often overused, one that should be reserved for those truly deserving of the recognition. What’s more, somewhat surprisingly, it’s a label that is frequently most applicable to those who may not seem like the larger-than-life figures to whom it’s most usually accorded. But, in the case of actor and activist Christopher Reeve (1952-2004), “hero” is an attribute most definitely warranted. Having burst onto the scene in the lead role of “Superman” (1978), he embodied the very notion of movie superhero, a character whose uplifting impact was definitely needed in a society deflated by many daunting challenges at the time. He would subsequently draw upon his success in this film as a springboard to a variety of other, more diverse roles, such as the lead in pictures like the mystical romance “Somewhere in Time” (1980) and the mystery thriller “Deathtrap” (1982), as well as a supporting part in the historical drama “The Remains of the Day” (1993). However, his life took a drastic turn in 1995, when he was nearly fatally injured in an equestrian accident that rendered him a paraplegic. The shock of the incident required a period of difficult adjustment for Reeve, but it would not ultimately deter him from carrying on in various pursuits with the unflinching support of his family and wife, Dana (1961-2006). He returned to acting in a made-for-TV version of “Rear Window” (1998) and assumed directorial responsibilities for the TV movies “In the Gloaming” (1997) and “The Brooke Ellison Story” (2004). He also became an ardent advocate for spinal cord injury care and research that gave hope – and, later, positive results – to many afflicted with this condition, leading to the establishment of an immensely successful charitable foundation and the passage of federal legislation bearing his and Dana’s names for furthering these worthy causes. Reeve’s inspiring story is now the subject of this new DC/HBO/CNN documentary from writer-directors Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui. It features a wealth of archive footage from interviews with the actor, family home movies and clips from his screen and stage performances, along with a variety of current and past conversations with his three children and his many friends and colleagues in the entertainment industry, including Robin Williams, Susan Sarandon, Whoopi Goldberg, Glenn Close, Jeff Daniels and director Richard Donner. Admittedly, the narrative can become somewhat redundant at times, suggesting the need for some judicious editing, but this release provides viewers with an insightful and heartfelt look at the values and virtues that made Reeve who he was – a true hero and a bona fide super man.",7.0
413846,1992,"Fresh out of the cinema after catching the 2024 film ""1992"" starring Tyrese Gibson and the late Ray Liotta, I was struck by its heavy racial themes. The movie, from its trailer to its execution, delves into the complexities of race relations head-on.

The plot revolves around a robbery at a local establishment that entangles a maintenance man and his son. Against the backdrop of a riot following the acquittal of police officers in the Rodney King beating case, the film exposes the harsh realities faced by the African-American community at the time.

""1992"" vividly portrays the deep-seated tensions and injustices prevalent in America during that era. It sheds light on the segregated society and the deeply ingrained prejudices that individuals held, shaped by their upbringing and surroundings.

Ray Liotta's character initially comes off as racist, but as the story unfolds, it becomes apparent that his disdain is directed towards everyone, not just a particular race. Liotta's performance is commendable, serving as a formidable antagonist to Tyrese Gibson's protagonist.

While Gibson's character strives for change and a better future for his son, he grapples with his own demons and past mistakes. Despite his flaws, he emerges as a beacon of hope in a tumultuous time.

However, the film itself feels like a chaotic mess, as if a novice writer penned the story without any feedback or editing. The direction and production also seem amateurish, giving off a first-time filmmaker vibe.

The lead actor seems miscast, lacking the presence of an action or suspense star, and the family dynamic feels off. The storyline is erratic, leading to a twist that falls flat, followed by a disappointing ending that leaves viewers feeling cheated.

We learn a little more about the causes of that and of his distant relationship with his zoo-keeping father as the story develops, as well as discovering that he once was one of the place's more famous citizens being in a popular local band. With the Beijing Olympiad (2008) looming large, there is quite an emphasis for the government on tarting the place up - and that signals quite significant ""improvements"" for their home on the edge of the Gobi desert. Much of it has already been earmarked for demolition, and with most of the heart (and soul) of the place already removed, the authorities turn their attention to the serious problem of hundreds of feral dogs marauding around potentially spreading rabies. There is one particularly skinny black one that is worth 1000 Yuan if it can be caught, and that's the target for the motor-cycling ""Lang"". Thing is, this mutt is no mug, and is soon doing more of the chasing (and biting). One particularly embarrassing nibble sees both confined to his home in quarantine and that's when the bonds begin to become established and we also realise the extent of hostility felt by some to this man. With the bulldozers never far away, his ailing dad's zoo no longer able to care for it's tenants and the vengeful butcher ""Hu"" (Hu Xiaoguang) and his thugs out for revenge, we settle into a tale of this newfound friendship that's quite engaging. It's predictable in stages, but it's really the largely dialogue-free effort from Peng set against a backdrop of relentless winds, dust and trains rolling through the increasingly lifeless town that gives this a bit of potency. It's not so much that the town is being cleared because of the Olympics, though that's clearly on director Hu Guan's mind, it's that why was a town ever here in this inhospitable place in the place? It's bleak and forlorn, a concrete oasis in the middle of nowhere and that setting works well as the man himself comes across as lonely, detached as well as emotionally and physically rootless. It's a slow watch, but not one that drags, for two hours and it rather effectively sums up an existence of mundanity, lack of opportunity and a desire for a true sense of freedom quite well.

1249423,Black dog,"Many films about the special relationship between man and his four-legged best friend have been made over the years, and it’s a formula that nearly always manages to please. So it is with the latest offering from writer-director Guan Hu, the story of a former inmate who’s been paroled to his hometown on the fringe of the Gobi Desert in northwestern China after 10 years in prison for a manslaughter conviction, an incident in which he had apparently become unwittingly involved. As he seeks to make amends for his past and start his life over, former motorcycle stunt artist/musician Lang Yonghui (Eddie Peng) returns to his roots as China had become engaged in an aggressive, ongoing national program of upgrading its infrastructure in preparation for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In this case, this undertaking is a much-needed improvement for a faltering community that has become seriously run down and depopulated. And that exodus, in turn, has created a secondary problem: as many former residents departed, they abandoned their pets (especially dogs), creating a population of strays that has now ballooned to overwhelming proportions. Given this preponderance of feral canines – many of whom have become unruly, vicious and a public health risk – local authorities are in desperate need of help in rounding them up. In light of that, as part of Lang’s government-sanctioned reintegration program, he is assigned to a job in animal control. But, as something of an unassuming soft touch, he struggles to carry out his duties. That becomes particularly true when he’s charged with corralling a gaunt, mangy, assertively territorial black dog (Xin) suspected of having rabies, a scenario that leads to a decidedly belligerent confrontation between man and beast. However, once the stray is in custody, Lang and his captive begin developing an unexpectedly close bond. Lang ends up adopting the pooch, and they thus embark on an odyssey of self-discovery for themselves and one another as they work through issues of their own making and the exploration of their newfound relationship. The result is a heartwarming tale filled with genuine affection and loving mutual support, admittedly sometimes a tad obvious in their depiction but undoubtedly always sincere to the core. The narrative truly works best when it focuses on this primary relationship, a story thread that, regrettably, is sometimes intruded upon a little too much by an array of subplots whose variable, sometimes under-explained development and occasionally meandering nature can detract from what works best. Nevertheless, these minor distractions aside, “Black Dog” is an otherwise-engaging, enjoyable saga of two outcasts in search of redemption and the wonders that the power of friendship can work for those looking to get their lives back on track. But, then, that’s why our four-legged furry companions have deservedly earned their reputation as man’s best friends. This winner of the 2024 Cannes Film Festival Un Certain Regard Award and Independent Spirit Award nominee for Best International Film is available for streaming online.",7.0
1159311,僕のヒーローアカデミア THE MOVIE ユアネクスト,"With ""All Might"" having lost most of his powers and now taken a back seat, it falls to the students of class 1A of the academy to do the policing of the undesirables in society and use their adaptable array of quirks to deliver these miscreants to the authorities. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, there appears a serious challenge to their regime when ""Dark Might"" emerges bent of replacing his august predecessor and imposing his own form of rule on a Japan he considers a pale imitation of it's former self. He is not without his own powerful hench-folk, and unwittingly one of those is the powerful ""Anna"" who can augment and corrupt the powers of others and whilst under an hypnotic spell be used to make this new oppressor nigh on unstoppable. It's down to the determined ""Deku"" and his new found ally ""Giulio"" to galvanise his nimble friends and find a way to thwart this monster before his city-sized aerial fort destroys their school, ""All Might"" and all that they stand for. It's a bit on the long side this, but there's still a solid story of good vs. evil underpinned by plenty of animated combat action, some great smashes - ""Manchester"" and ""Torino"" maybe being a little more potent than ""Grape Juice"" and some effort has been made to imbue the characters with a little more personality as we discover more about who both their nemesis and the manipulated ""Anna"" actually are. It can be a bit repetitive at times and it has a couple of goes at concluding, but I still quite enjoyed it.",7.0
870360,The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie,"As a massive Looney Tunes fan, it was questionable whether or not The Day the Earth Blew Up would even see the light of day let alone be released theatrically. Originally conceived as an HBO Max (now Max) original, the company decided not to release it at all.

Unlike Bye Bye Bunny: A Looney Tunes Musical which was canceled mid-production and Coyote vs. Acme which is a fully completed film that was shelved, The Day the Earth Blew Up was shopped around to other distributors where GFM Animation picked it up for theatrical distribution.

In The Day the Earth Blew Up, Porky and Daffy have practically been together since birth. They’re raised by a burly, bearded, lumberjack-looking farmer named Farmer Jim. As the two grow up together, Daffy is the crazier of the two whereas Porky kind of goes with whatever Daffy does without voicing how he feels.

After Farmer Jim waddles off into the sunset (literally), Porky and Daffy are left with his home which they run into the ground over a handful of years. After trying to tend to various minor repairs before a neighborhood standards review, they are given ten days to fix the gigantic hole in their roof that they somehow overlooked. Otherwise, their house will be condemned.

Meanwhile, a meteor has crash-landed on Earth which smashes through Porky and Daffy’s roof upon entry. The meteor brings a strange bright green alien goo with it. After Porky and Daffy struggle to find a job to help pay for their roof, gum flavor scientist Petunia Pig comes along and offers them jobs at the Goodie Gum factory.

However, the scientist who discovered the meteor has been brainwashed by the goo and dumps more goo into the factory’s latest gum flavor batch that is shipping worldwide. Whoever chews this infected batch is turned into a gum-chewing zombie and the only one that knows about it is a lunatic duck that nobody believes.

The Day the Earth Blew Up takes a ton of influence from Bob Clampett; not only from the Looney Tunes shorts he directed but his animation style as well. The film is traditional animation, which means it’s hand-drawn, and every line of dialogue has a variety of memorable facial expressions that feel like they’re lifted straight out of The Great Piggy Bank Robbery (1946).

The animated sci-fi comedy has a long list of influences including several Bob Clampett shorts from 1946 including Kitty Kornered and Baby Bottleneck, old school creature features such as The Thing and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and surprisingly a meteor drilling story point that feels like it’s lifted straight out of Armageddon or The Core.

The film has a whopping 11 credited writers and four story consultants, which after watching the film isn’t surprising. The film changes course and objectives countless times over an all-too-quick 90 minutes. For those unaware, when HBO Max launched it was the streaming location for animated content. Part of that content was a new batch of Looney Tunes Cartoons that ran for six seasons. These new shorts took heavy inspiration from the original Looney Tunes with crisp animation, were still totally gag-driven, and even had a more adult kind of vibe much like Ren and Stimpy.

The Day the Earth Blew Up was created during that Looney Tunes Cartoons stint on Max, so it has similar high-quality animation. The film toys with lighting in a way that makes it feel like a classic horror film with drastic color changes and heavy shadows. And the monster and alien designs are so much fun. The lead alien, known only as The Invader, has a plan for Earth that is too absurd not to love.

The Day the Earth Blew Up deserves all of the support it can get. The film feels like a last chance for the Looney Tunes franchise to be successful. Traditional animation is also rare these days. When the inevitable embrace of AI is just around the corner and everything animated relies on CGI these days, hand-drawn animation hasn’t looked this good since Cuphead.

The Day the Earth Blew Up is a crazy unique take on alien invasion and zombie films with a Looney Tunes twist that is fun and hysterical. The eye-popping animation is gorgeous and glorious. This is a film for Looney Tunes fans, horror, sci-fi, and film fans alike. It captures the magic of the classics while delivering something entirely fresh and worthwhile.",8.0
1128752,Bird,"There are two lovely performances to enjoy in this story of the twelve year old ""Bailey"" (Nykiya Adams). She lives in a squat with her dad ""Bug"" (Barry Keoghan), brother ""Hunter"" (Jason Buda) and her soon-to-be stepmum ""Kayleigh"" (Frankie Box). It's that impending wedding, and the wearing of a pretty garish pink cat-suit, that puts her at odds with her well-meaning dad and sees her left to amuse herself amidst the fields of Kent. It's there that she encounters the rather enigmatic ""Bird"" (Franz Rogowski) who is looking for his parents who lived in a Gravesend tower block near her home. She decides to try and help this rather quirky chap and quickly their lives become curiously linked as we discover that her mother (Jasmine Jobson) is struggling through an abusive relationship with boyfriend ""Skate"" (James Nelson-Joyce) whilst also trying to bring up three youngsters. With the quest for her new friend's parents, her desire to help her mum and siblings and her dad's pressure to engage with his own hopes for happiness, the young ""Bailey"" hasn't her challenges to seek. Keoghan features energetically as he zips around the housing estates on his e-scooter, and his character serves well to help keep the main characterisations going - and it's on that front there's a charmingly understated chemistry developed between Adams and Rogowski that mixes their respective back-stories with a soupçon of the mystic and plenty of allegorical imagery to introduce quite elusive themes of freedom, family and quite frequently fun, too. There are also some fairly violent undertones, and we are left in no doubt that her life and that of her family has been and will remain fairly turbulent - but those points are not brought to us via a sledge-hammer, more by gentle observation and development of engaging personalities that evolve gently but potently over a couple of hours. It's a slow burn, but it works.",7.0
1128752,Bird,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://movieswetextedabout.com/bird-review-a-thoughtful-study-of-the-fragile-line-between-innocence-and-adolescence/

""Bird is a raw, honest portrayal that, despite some pacing issues and a challenging blend of fantasy and reality, offers a deeply human experience elevated by Nykiya Adams' impressively genuine performance.

Andrea Arnold controls her original narrative with an intimate, sensitive lens on the struggles and inner conflicts of a young girl in transition, highlighting both the complexities of adolescence and the fragile beauty of childhood innocence.

For those who find themselves captivated by Bailey's introspection and vulnerability, Bird will undoubtedly be a poignant, lasting story.""

Rating: B-",6.0
1128752,Bird,"Andrea Arnold's return to fiction filmmaking with Bird is nothing short of magical. I'm admittedly biased — give me a dash of magic surrealism and I'm already halfway to being won over. But Bird soars well beyond mere genre appeal.

At its heart, this is a coming-of-age story centered on Bailey, portrayed by newcomer Nykiya Adams in what can only be described as a revelation of a performance. It's not just me gushing here — Adams has already collected five Breakthrough Performance awards, and rightfully so. There's something raw and undeniable in her presence that makes me certain we'll be seeing much more of her.

The film follows Arnold's characteristic focus on young women living on society's margins, but this time through a lens that feels both fresh and familiar. Franz Rogowski (honestly, is there a thoughtful European indie he's not in?) brings his trademark subtlety to his role as Bailey's counterpart. The rest of the supporting cast holds their own admirably, creating a world that feels lived-in and authentic.

But it's Arnold's underlying optimism that really gets me. Throughout the film, she weaves this beautiful thread about the nature of love — how we all love differently, imperfectly, sometimes messily. And that's okay. More than okay, actually. It's a profound truth that some of us spend decades trying to understand: that love, in whatever form it takes, doesn't need to meet some arbitrary standard to be valid.

The way Arnold brings this message home — through her distinctive visual style and moments of subtle magic — well, it just works. Really works. Though I should mention the somewhat dizzying handheld camerawork in the opening scenes nearly threw me off. But perhaps that's fitting for a film about imperfect love — even its minor flaws feel purposeful, like they're part of the larger truth Arnold is sharing with us.

By the time the credits rolled, I found myself sitting there, a bit misty-eyed, thinking about all the different ways people manage to love each other in this complicated world of ours. Not perfect? Sure. That's rather the point, isn't it?",9.0

Truly a 'Midnight Movie' yet, was in competition at Cannes 76! Have your expectation set now, the drunker you are the better this will be! 

Can’t wait for the sequel: Fruit Flies

FADE OUT.",4.0
628922,Asphalt City,"Director Jean-Stéphane Sauvaire thoroughly succeeds at creating a bleak atmosphere of despair in “Asphalt City,” a dark, challenging project that is going to be a tough watch for many viewers. Based on the 2008 novel “Black Flies” by Shannon Burke, the film delves into the gritty reality of New York City as seen and experienced through the eyes of paramedics navigating the chaos and violence that beats beneath the urban jungles of America.

The film tells the story of a young paramedic named Ollie Cross (Tye Sheridan) who, in preparation for medical school, is assigned to the night shift with seasoned partner Gene Rutkovsky (Sean Penn). Every 911 call reveals a city in crisis as the men put their lives in danger to help others, but the nightly horrors send Ollie down a nightmarish rabbit hole that takes a serious toll on his mental health.

The film offers a visceral and unflinching look at the harsh realities of emergency medicine, and the opening minutes plunge viewers into the heart of the action. Riding along in the ambulance with these men, Sauvaire creates a palpable and dramatic realism that sets the tone for the rest of the film. It’s not pleasant, but it’s undeniably gripping.

The themes at play are complex, especially the exploration of moral and ethical ambiguity that plagues the characters. The story takes a dark turn as it unfolds, giving an unflinching look at the psychological toll of witnessing trauma and death that’s all in an evening’s work for these men. Mental health breakdowns ensue, leading to a violent change in Ollie’s personality and a descent into darkness. Things get even worse when the men start to act on their belief that they’re saviors who are playing God on the streets of NYC.

A word of warning to the squeamish: the medical scenes offer a highly realistic and extremely gruesome portrayal of emergency medical procedures. They are vivid and grisly, and those who can’t handle blood and gore will have a hard time with this film. Medical enthusiasts, however, will appreciate the attention to detail and authenticity.

Despite boasting strong performances and a gripping narrative, “Asphalt City” fizzles with a corny ending that falls victim to clichéd dark drama tropes. I really loved the majority of the film, though, and it’s so bleak that I felt the need to wash off the layer of darkness and despair that I could feel clinging to me long after the credits rolled.

1215162,Kill 'em All 2,"Someone really needs to step up and let Jean-Claude Van Damme know that the whole ""killing everyone while he survives"" movie formula just doesn’t work anymore.

This movie is almost as bad as Steven Seagal’s—completely impossible and with plotlines that are beyond comprehension.",
1215162,Kill 'em All 2,"Jean Claude Van Damme can actually act. I saw him hand in a decent performance in the regrettably short lived, satirical series, Jean-Claude Van Johnson.

So given its clear he's not just ""another cookie cutter action star"" why on earth then, can't they tailor a decent script, for the man? All we seem to get is a regurgitation of past martial arts, action films, from the 20th century, he starred in, only worse again.

Kill Em All 2 a case in question. This is simply a platform for Van Damme's  martial arts skills. Skills that are admittedly impressive, especially given the mans in his 60's. That said, everything else that makes any film work, like a decent script, with a strong back story and characterisations, is mostly absent. 

Come on Hollywood, you can do better than this for Van Damme, surely? 

In summary, a film that is little more than a showcase for Van Damme's martial arts prowess, minus pretty much everything else that makes a quality action film, well, a quality action film.",3.0
949484,Hounds of War,"Hounds of War is a somewhat better than average B grade military action flick. 

Its suggestion that the US is complicit in terrorism, is rather boldly honest but any claim the political establishment in that country has recognised this shortcoming or moved to address it, is far fetched. 

Action in this film is reasonably well done. Lots of gun play and polished fight scenes, keep this film rolling along. Frank Grillo is as likeable as ever and not a bad choice, for the lead in a film of this kind. 

In summary, Hounds of War meets the conventional action flick criteria and even manages to offer up a naive, if hopeful message, about the US's role in the world today. Certainly worth a look.",6.0

1020896,Håndtering av udøde,"Given how much I enjoyed Let the Right one In, I had high hopes for Norwegian production, Handling the Undead. Hopes that were slowly eroded, over the course of this film. 

Yes, I could talk about this being haunting and meaningful, on a vague and nebulous level but I wont. In reality, this essentially is a slow burn zombie film with an outcome no different from any other zombie flick. The key departure is this film is maudlin, lacks pace, an underlying meaning and is generally, downright depressing. 

I could have rated this down further but there is nothing wrong with the quality of the acting, cinematography, etc, its the underlying script, for me, that doesn't work. 

In summary, whilst Let the Right One in was amazing, I felt this is its antithesis. Without beating around the bush, trying to unearth some hidden meaning, in this reviewers opinion, its simply crummy. My advice, if you like zombie flicks, most are better than this.",4.0

I like slow movies with long shots when there's a script and a point to it, but this is just toe-cringingly pathetic and pretentious with zero talent or story to back it up.

What a boring clown show. It also looks like poop. 90% of scenes have grays instead of blacks (even a scene where the entire power grid is down, and it's supposed to be pitch dark), and it looks like someone made an analog copy of a copy of a copy, dragged it through mud, and then scanned it.

There's the familiar face of go-to guy for baddies from this part of the world Radu Serbedzija and there are a few appearances from Anthony Michael Hall - who's acting hasn't improved much since the days of the 'Breakfast Club"" (1985) but otherwise this is all very basic, low budget, single camera stuff that hasn't an original bone in it's body. It's scripted competently, I'd say, but the acting is very ordinary and the portrayal of the US President as the stereotypical all-action hero as adept with a machine gun as he is with a microphone just summed this whole rather daft thing up.

1101448,Unstoppable,"Anthony Robles is a wrestler with ambitions to reach the top of the American collegiate championships. That's going to be more of a challenge for him than most as he only has one leg, but this is not a man who is going to shy away from that challenge. It's a competent Jharrel Jerome who plays him for the dramatic elements of the story whilst it's the man himself doing the far more energetic wrestling aspects and the unremarkalble Jennifer Lopez simply fails to shine at all as his mother, caught up in a torrid relationship. When this drama focusses on the sheer passion of this man and his determination to succeed, it works well enough, but it spends far too much time on the familial discord aspects of their lives. Sure, these are contributory factors to the remarkable nature of his achievements, but they drag the pace down and soak us in a melodrama that rather takes from the potency of a story that's well worth the telling. Michael Peña delivers better as his no-nonsense but ultimately motivational coach and the action photography really does give us a sense of the effort and hard work required by Robles to prove to his peers and himself that he had what it takes to reach the top in a very competitive sport where he would be given no quarter. Personally, I'd have preferred a documentary to this drama as Robles himself is the star and the others really just clutter up the story with their over-scripted dialogue and sentimentality. I did quite like the intimate nature of the photography during the action scenes. A bit juddery at times, but it made the action on the mat all the more visceral for a character who lived and breathed his sport. It just goes to show what can be achieved when the attitude is positive and the support structure is there to facilitate that.",6.0
1066262,The Convert,"In spite of a few shortcomings, I mostly liked The Convert.

Firstly, there's Australian actor, Guy Pierce. Pierce who is, in my opinion, fantastic. Its been quite a while since I've seen him in anything, I'd personally consider worthwhile, so this film made for a welcome change. 

Another upside, is a reasonable, if overcooked story (I'll come to that) which  offers insights into early colonial life in New Zealand. In particular, it taps into the conflict between Maori tribes (the native people) and the newly arrived colonists. 

It's not a bad tale but as is often the case, it overplays its hand. The colonists are depicted as largely narrow minded, racist bigots. Its fair to say there was indeed racism (and still is). Its also true, however that the reason there are no pure Maori left in New Zealand, is because they integrated with the new arrivals.Its a bit hard to overstate the race card, when you stop to consider this fact. 

That said, there remains a heck of a lot to like here. Great performances, convincing characterisations and action  that's a little implausible, at times, but still well done and generally entertaining.

1306764,Outside,"I haven't seen all zombie films but this seems like a somewhat different approach. Yes they are all full of conflict as movies showing people trying to survive a zombie apocalypse usually are. But having a family deal with the aftereffects and the current threat of a potential relationship break up during an apocalyptic event where the couple is forced to stay together seems different. I guess they've explored that somewhat in long series such as the Walking Dead but zombie movies in general seem more packed with action than drama. The Walking Dead though, at some point, became too soap operaish to be satisfying to me. I couldn't finish it. Outside manages to be satisfying in the length of a movie rather than having to invest loads of time as in a series. 

The main character, the dad, can't control his anger at that situation nor see that the event they are experiencing far eclipses a breakup of a relationship. Seems he was probably a somewhat unhinged person who couldn't or wouldn't control himself prior to the zombie apocalypse and now he sees a chance to try to control his spouse but she's not having it (or at least trying not to). 

They were all excellent actors but I really enjoyed the dad character the most as that character was propelling the story along. The actor playing him did such a great job with that role too. I'd recommend this movie. I think it has a nice balance of thriller action and drama.",9.0

Their lives are only ever broken up by the disturbance of the train as it passes through, and it’s when praying to that one day that she thinks she hears a baby crying. Searching the snow, she quickly discovers an infant wrapped in a distinctive blanket and quickly takes it to their home. Her husband, though, feels the child to be an ill omen and wants nothing to do with it, so with her and the bairn confined to the cold of the woodshed, she has to try to find it some milk! That’s just the start of her travails, though, as we are gradually clued in to where this baby came from, and of the fate that awaited it’s parents that led to such a desperate act of love. What now ensues follows her struggle to keep herself and the child from an increasingly approaching war that had hitherto largely left them be, and that might ultimately dot the i’s and cross the t’s of a story that is touching, courageous and heartening. The almost constant wintery scenario adds an additional chill to a stylishly presented animation that features a sparing degree of dialogue, but some fairly effective audio effects to help create a variety of emotions as the child begins to grow and this simple, decent, family find they no longer have their problems to seek. It’s perhaps the last half hour that resonates most, as threads of the tale start to bind together revealing a degree of bleakness and inhumanity on one hand and yet the diametric opposite on the other.

975056,Cabrini,"Cristiana Dell'Anna delivers strongly here as the eponymous nun determined to set up a network of orphanages in China to help the sick and impoverished children there. Her persistent hassling of the Vatican for permission - and funds - has finally wound them up to the point where she is invited to Rome to be finally told no. Even there, though, she's sticking to her guns and after a persuasive audience with Pope Leo XIII (Giancarlo Giannini) manages to get permission to prove her worth - only in New York! To it's slum and run-down Five Points district she is sent and what now begins is an adventure that tests her very mettle as the, at best indifferent, attitude of the Archbishop (David Morse) is more concerned with appeasing the Mayor (John Lithgow) than facilitating her wishes for profound change. It's curious that in a city founded by immigrants there existed such a polarity of the Italian, the Jewish and Irish communities offering little, if any, tolerance of the other. Cabrini realises that neither her religion nor her status as a nun is going to help her - she is going to have to recruit local urchins and fight for every scrap of progress. It's history, so we do know what ultimately happens but Alejandro Monteverde has produced a classy looking portrait that still imbues enough jeopardy into the proceedings as she struggles. Her single-minded determination, her bloody-mindedness - all tempered with huge amounts of humanity and decency are well portrayed here. This is a very good looking film, and the narrative also demonstrates clearly the diminished role of women in what purported to be an open and democratic society - American and Italian, and a class system that cared little for those who lived on the wrong side of the tracks. It's a bit long - there are moments that slow the pace down and drag the story, but in the main this is a poignant telling of the story of a woman who was prepared to sacrifice whatever was necessary for those less privileged.",7.0

975056,Cabrini,"Providing care, comfort and compassion to the world’s downtrodden is undoubtedly a noble, if exhausting and often-frustrating, cause, especially when pleas for help go ignored or fall on deaf ears. Yet, every so often, someone comes along who tirelessly keeps on fighting for those less fortunate, as was the case with Italian immigrant Mother Francesca Cabrini (Cristiana Dell’Anna). Upon her arrival in New York in 1889, the diminutive but zealous nun from Lombardy set about her work to care for her fellow countrymen and women (especially orphaned and abandoned children) in desperate need of food, housing and medical care, the first charitable undertaking of what she envisioned becoming a worldwide network of such ventures. She successfully raised awareness of the plight of these emigrees by getting the attention of a New York Times reporter (Jeremy Bobb), an endeavor that garnered support for her efforts and challenged the prejudicial attitudes of the public and New York’s municipal government, including its bigoted, intolerant mayor (John Lithgow). And, through it all, she wrestled with personal health issues that hung over her for many years. Writer-director Alejandro Monteverde’s latest presents a detailed, well-told biography of a woman who wouldn’t give up at a time when the deck was stacked against her, both on the bases of her gender and nationality, as well as (in some cases) as a representative of the Church. The picture’s superb production design, fine period piece production values and gorgeous cinematography lend much to this release, as do the performances of Dell’Anna and Lithgow, along with a host of supporting characters. Despite these strengths, though, this slightly overlong offering has occasional problems with pacing, monodimensional character development, overdramatic elements (particularly in the soundtrack) and an underdeveloped back story. At the same time, however, “Cabrini” tells an inspiring and uplifting tale of someone who accomplished a lot but hasn’t really received the attention she’s due. This film helps to make up for that oversight while reminding us all that we can play a part in fulfilling her dream of genuinely creating an empire of hope for the world.",7.0

801688,కల్కి 2898-ఎ.డి,"# Kalki 2898 AD: A Visionary Blend of Mythology and Sci-Fi

In the ever-evolving landscape of Indian cinema, ""Kalki 2898 AD"" emerges as a groundbreaking spectacle that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and visual artistry. Directed by the visionary Nag Ashwin, this ambitious project weaves together elements of ancient mythology and futuristic science fiction, creating a tapestry that is as thought-provoking as it is visually stunning.

## A Tale Across Millennia

Set in a dystopian future, ""Kalki 2898 AD"" draws its core narrative from the depths of Hindu mythology, specifically the Mahabharata. The film follows the prophesied hero Kalki, played by Prabhas, on a journey to restore balance to a world teetering on the brink of chaos. Ashwin's screenplay masterfully bridges the gap between the ancient and the futuristic, creating a narrative that feels both timeless and urgently relevant.

## Visual Splendor and Technical Prowess

One of the film's most striking aspects is its visual presentation. The production design team has crafted a post-apocalyptic world that is both believable and awe-inspiring. From the gritty, lived-in feel of rebel hideouts to the sleek, oppressive architecture of the antagonist's strongholds, every frame is a feast for the eyes.

The visual effects, while occasionally uneven, often reach heights of breathtaking spectacle. Scenes of futuristic cityscapes and epic battles showcase the film's ambition and the technical capabilities of Indian cinema. Santhosh Narayanan's score complements the visuals perfectly, adding emotional depth and excitement to key moments.

## Star-Studded Performances

The cast of ""Kalki 2898 AD"" reads like a who's who of Indian cinema, and for the most part, they deliver. Prabhas brings a mix of intensity and vulnerability to Kalki, though his character development feels somewhat uneven across the film's runtime. Deepika Padukone shines in her role, bringing strength and emotional resonance to her character.

However, it's Amitabh Bachchan who steals the show with a commanding performance that anchors the film's more philosophical moments. Kamal Haasan's appearance as the antagonist Yaskin is brief but impactful, leaving audiences wanting more.

## Ambitious Storytelling with Room for Improvement

While the film's ambition is commendable, its execution occasionally falters. The pacing in the first half can feel sluggish, with some scenes stretched beyond necessity. The narrative complexity, while intriguing, sometimes verges on convoluted, potentially leaving viewers struggling to keep up with the intertwining plotlines.

However, the film hits its stride in the final act, delivering a series of revelations and set pieces that are truly exhilarating. The climax not only provides a satisfying conclusion to the immediate story but also tantalizes with hints of a larger cinematic universe to come.

## A New Benchmark for Indian Cinema

Despite its flaws, ""Kalki 2898 AD"" represents a significant leap forward for Indian cinema. Nag Ashwin's vision in blending mythology with science fiction opens up exciting new possibilities for storytelling in the industry. The film's willingness to tackle complex themes and its technical achievements set a new benchmark for what is possible in Indian filmmaking.

## Conclusion

""Kalki 2898 AD"" is more than just a movie; it's an experience. While it may not be perfect, its ambition, visual splendor, and the questions it poses about destiny, technology, and the cyclical nature of good and evil make it a must-watch for fans of both Indian cinema and science fiction. As the first installment in what promises to be an epic saga, ""Kalki 2898 AD"" lays a foundation that leaves audiences eagerly anticipating what's to come.

**Rating: 4 out of 5 stars**

Bold, ambitious, and visually stunning, ""Kalki 2898 AD"" heralds a new era for Indian cinema, blending mythology and futurism in a way that's never been seen before on the silver screen.",
801688,కల్కి 2898-ఎ.డి,"The mythology that underpins this is a fascinating combination of humanity and adventure that director Nag Ashwin presents entertainingly - if maybe a little haphazardly - here. We start with a battle from history where the defeated ""Ashwatthama"" is condemned to a life of fruitless immortality. His only chance of redemption will come when he is called upon to protect an unborn child - the final reincarnation of Vishnu. At this point we don't know when this will happen, nor what these dangers might be - but skip forward six thousand years and we find a world where the planet is under the control of the ""Complex"". An alien looking enterprise that is systematically robbing the planet of it's nutrients and minerals under the control of the ""Supreme Yaskin"" (Kamal Haasan). Things are especially perilous times for women capable of childbearing as they are being genetically manipulated to produce a serum from their foetus that is implanted into ""Yaksin"" to grant him his own form of (tube free) immortality. Meantime, we are introduced to the legendary bounty hunter ""Bhairava"" (Prabhas) who has something of the ""Han Solo"" to him, and who is working to get the million credits required to get into the ""Complex"". There is one further enigma amongst all of this ordered chaos. She is ""Sum 80"" (Deepika Padukone) as she is pregnant - and naturally, too. Needless to say she is much prized by the ""Complex"" but after some careful planning, she manages to escape the clutches of it's scientists and make a break for ""Shambala"" where legend has it, she will give birth to a very special baby. In hot pursuit is the malevolent commander ""Manas"" (Saswata Chatterjee) who has mobilised an whole army of unsavoury types to track her down - and with a prize of 5 million for the person who delivers her, well ""Bhairava"" is soon in on the chase too. If he can help this woman, perhaps ""Ashwatthama"" can fulfil his destiny? Now this is long, and at times it loses it's way a little with the oddly positioned entertainment numbers spliced into the drama, but for the most part - particularly after the interval - this is quite an action packed hybrid of Hindu folklore combined with elements of ""Dune"" (especially much of the scoring), ""Avatar"" and featuring a guest appearance from ""Skeletor's"" big chair from ""Masters of the Universe"" towards the end. I wouldn't have said the acting is all that remarkable, but Prabhas provides a charismatic effort, the dialogue generally works efficiently and the production design is creatively effective at mixing the futuristic with the ancient. There's no getting away from it's reliance on CGI, and that doesn't always work, but the story is sound and clearly designed to give us more down the line as the ancient gods line up against the pillagers of the planet - with the very future of mankind to play for.",7.0

My Score : 86/100

In the landscape of modern commercial filmmaking, few directors manage to strike a balance between emotion, action, and drama. Siddharth Anand, with his latest venture Fighter, not only meets this challenge but does so with flying colors. Gripping from the start, it offers a rollercoaster of drama, deep emotion, and pulsating aerial action, enticing dog fights all resulting in an experience crafted for big screens. While patriotic elements are skillfully incorporated, the film celebrates friendship and confronts the weight of the past, providing nuanced character portrayals and their dynamics. The strong emotional arc, supported by stellar performances, especially by Hrithik Roshan and Anil Kapoor, leaves a lasting impact. The thrilling screenplay, excellent a and some cheesy dialogues in addition to spectacular VFX enhance key scenes, making Fighter a must-watch cinematic triumph under Anand's proven and evolved directorial prowess.


Balanced Mastery: Fighter, directed by Siddharth Anand, excels in modern commercial filmmaking by skillfully balancing emotion, action, and drama. Yes it has cheesy dialogues , some melodramatic scenes and forced humour at places but the overall product is far more captivating and hence overshadows minor hiccups

Cinematic Rollercoaster: The film grips audiences from the start, offering a thrilling rollercoaster of high drama, deep emotion, and pulsating aerial action, urging a big-screen experience. The VFX is excellent barring the climatic moments. 

Nuanced Storytelling: Fighter sets itself apart with a rich tapestry of storytelling, seamlessly weaving patriotic elements, friendship celebration, and confronting the heavy baggage of the past. The character arcs of Hrithik, Deepika and Anil come to a full circle leaving you overwhelmed with a rewarding satisfaction.

Emotional Impact: A standout feature is the film's strong emotional arc, supported by stellar performances, particularly Hrithik Roshan scorching eyes and his excellent screen presence. He is charming, vulnerable, helpless, revengeful and sarcastic all in a single film. He is just too good. Anil Kapoor and his tensed chemistry with HR is worth watching where Anil dominates. Deepika Padukone, leaving a lasting impact on audiences with her appropriate role.

Directorial Triumph: Fighter stands as a testament to Siddharth Anand's directorial skills, executing a tough film superbly with a perfect blend of action, drama, emotions, scale, and sweet humor, making it a must-watch cinematic experience. He focuses on passing message from time to time in the film that the war is with terrorism and not a particular country. He has evolved brilliantly and his bond with HR shows how deeply he admires the actor and vice versa. Mass with Class shining bright along with Hrithik’s masterclass.

1241674,The Last Breath,"When the long-hidden wreck of the battleship ""USS Charlotte"" is discovered, it proves a must-explore opportunity for a visiting collection of erstwhile college students. Initially, ""Noah"" (Jack Parr) isn't keen on taking them all, but when he discovers that his local bar-owning mate ""Levi"" (Julian Sands) is $36k in the hole, he teases the the cash from the arrogant ass that is ""Brett"" (Alexander Arnold) and so down they go. Initially, all goes well enough but you have to remember that a battleship is a large construction with loads of corridors, ladders, portholes and especially with this one - rust. As this entitled and hungover bunch of travellers enter deeper into the infrastructure, they also meet a problem a little more menacing. Sharks like it down there too, and they are hungry for some rubbery frat sandwiches. What with a maze of collapsing ironworks, the odd dead body and now these marauding man/woman eating fish, we are set for quite an underwater adventure full of squealing and screaming with acting and dialogue that had me wanting to sign up for my local adopt-an-elasmobranch society. The photography works quite well and it does generate a little tension, but the rest of it just hammy comic book stuff where the cast deserve all the chewing they get. the sparingly featured Julian Sands must have fancied a free holiday somewhere warm, else he had a tax bill to settle - otherwise this is entirely forgettable fayre that we've all seen before and won't need to see again.

1184495,Joy,"_Joy_ directed by Ben Taylor, delves into the overlooked story of Jean Purdy, a key figure in the creation of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). The film not only brings to light Purdy's often ignored contributions but also serves as a critique of the long-standing marginalisation of women in scientific breakthroughs. It aims to reclaim a narrative that has historically sidelined the role of women in such significant achievements.

Ben Taylor's direction chronicles the groundbreaking development of IVF with an approach reminiscent of a sports film. Though the audience knows the outcome—over two million children have been conceived via IVF since 1979—the film immerses you in the highs and lows, triumphs and failures, leading to the birth of Louise Brown, the world's first ""test-tube baby.""

Thomasin McKenzie's portrayal of Purdy stands out, adding depth to a character who faced significant professional and personal challenges. Bill Nighy offers a memorable turn as surgeon Patrick Steptoe, blending compassion and wit. At the same time, James Norton brings warmth to the role of scientist Robert Edwards. Together, the trio captures the tension, camaraderie, and determination needed to challenge societal and scientific norms.

The film's strength lies in its focus on the procedural breakthroughs and emotional and ethical dilemmas its protagonists face. It frames the IVF journey as a collective struggle against deep-seated prejudices, balancing moments of triumph with the harsh realities of rejection and scepticism. However, some aspects of the storytelling feel superficial, and the film needs to fully dive into its characters' complexities.

The marginalisation of women in the scientific and medical fields is an ongoing issue. Historically, many female scientists have been overshadowed by their male counterparts. For example, Rosalind Franklin's pivotal work in discovering the structure of DNA was primarily credited to James Watson and Francis Crick. Similarly, the film _Hidden Figures_ brought to light the incredible contributions of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson—African-American women mathematicians at NASA—whose work was crucial to the space program's success but went uncelebrated for decades.

_Joy_ is a commendable effort to highlight an important figure and the persistence required behind one of modern medicine's significant achievements. While the film has flaws, it succeeds in shedding light on Purdy's legacy and the crucial role of women in scientific innovation, ensuring their contributions are finally acknowledged.",6.0

848439,Firebrand,"This rather sumptuous historical drama starts off with a caption that tells us we are all taught from history books about men and war. That appears to serve the purpose of excusing what comes next from at attempts to reflect what little is actually known of Katherine Parr. She was the final wife of England's Henry VIII and was known as a woman who favoured the translation of the bible from Latin into English to broaden it's access by the people. She (Alicia Vikander) quickly finds a powerful enemy in Bishop Gardiner (Sir Simon Russell Beale) who strives to prove the point of her friend, the rabble-rouser, Anne Askew (Erin Doherty) that it's important to the clergy and, indeed, to the King himself (Jude Law) that the interpretation of God's word is left to those more qualified - and certainly more adept at controlling the message it might convey! With Askew's life in constant danger, the Queen tries to help and that brings her cat and mouse game with Gardiner to an perilous head for a women married to a distrusting man who still obsesses about having another son as as spare to Prince Edward (Patrick Buckley). What Karim Aïnzou has managed here is to create something that looks authentic. The attention to the detail is lavish and depicts court life in quite a potent fashion. From singing to savagery in seconds being quite the norm. The thrust of the story itself, though, is thin and really struggles to pad out the two hours. There are too many lingering close ups, the pace of the thing is glacially slow and even the most basic of the aforementioned history books tells you what does happen in the end, so the attempts at jeopardy - though they do sometimes illustrate that being queen offered her little protection from the scheming plotters eyeing the secession - falls a bit flat. Though I did quite like the idea of the denouement, it's not remotely plausible and that rather sums up this disappointing drama that's very heavy on the speculation and doesn't really give Vikander much meat to put on the bones of a story about a women caught up in the dregs of this despotic Tudor reign.",6.0

For background info, I love Pharrell. He is my favorite artist and he has been for a long time now. My parents listen to that type of music so I got it from them. I love his music. So I was going in expecting a fun time with great music and I would probably learn a thing or two. But damn, I got so much more. I love the way Pharrell thinks. The way he sees life. It might seem crazy what I'm about to say but this movie changed my perspective on things. On life. The music was amazing just as expected. A lot of Pharrell’s music is nostalgic to me. So hearing these songs just made me feel so nostalgic. The movie is funny too. Not the funniest thing ever but it is funny at times. Guys, don’t compare this to the other Lego movies that came before. They are wildly different types of films. So just because it’s a movie using Lego as their animation style, don’t compare them.

His increasingly pivotal position in African American culture is all laid out like a yellow brick road, bumps and all, but none of it is particularity interesting. It isn't that different from the story that could be told by almost anyone trying to make it in the entertainment industry - actors, singers, musicians. There are the occasional graphics to tell us who is who, but the lego-fication of the animation sometimes makes it quite difficult to tell the characters apart and it does rely on quite a bit of knowledge of the man's career and of hip-hop to take much from it.

Despite a decent effort from Justice Smith's ""Aren"" (and his impressive collection of knitwear) I just wasn't. Relying on long forgotten (if, indeed, they were ever actually known in the first place) tropes about racial stereotyping - and not just those from an African American point of view, makes this actually quite an offensive film to watch. Perhaps I am overthinking it, but I found absolutely nothing here with which I could relate - sarcastically or otherwise. The comedy, such as it is, is entirely contrived and the romantic elements between ""Aren"", ""Lizzie"" (An-Li Bogan) and ""Jason"" (Drew Tarver) are badly written and frequently cringe-makingly acted out. Peppering the thing with a few ""Harry Potter"" style magical effects and adding the benign characterisation of ""Barber"" (Aaron Colman) so that this ""Society"" can spend their entire time trying to ""fix"" the problems of their hapless and hopelessly out of their emotional depth white contemporaries just falls flat. It simply isn't funny. If a load of white folk got together and decided to make a movie about a group of innately obsequious and subservient non-white people, it would (and should) be banned. This is a clumsy and unfunny reinforcement of flawed values seen from an wholly unrealistic perspective and I struggled to sit through it, then wondered just why I bothered.

1039773,The American Society of Magical Negroes,"<em>'The American Society of Magical Negroes'</em> is hit-and-miss. I wasn't disliking it all that much, though when the credits rolled I kinda didn't have anything majorly noteworthy to think about it. Like the score is genuinely ace and the cast are alright, but that's it.

It's pretty forgettable (as a movie anyway, because that title isn't!), is what it boils down to. The well intentioned messaging comes across as a bit heavy-handed, as it only really dishes out pretty obvious sentiments. With that said, it can be a tad amusing (<em>'The Green Mile'</em> got a chuckle out of me, intentionally or otherwise) in short spells.

David Alan Grier plays his role well though, he is an actor I like. Justice Smith is decent, I'm yet to overly like any performance of his but fine he is. An-Li Bogan stands out most from the rest. To be honest, they could've just had a fully fledged romcom with Smith and Bogan, it probably would've worked nicely.

It would certainly help if you’d seen the rest of the series, but the studios are getting much better at packaging these cinema releases to make sense on their own without detailed previous knowledge of the characters, and this action drama does just about enough even if it is very long for what it is, and there is a great deal of padding.",6.0

1165466,Wake Up,"House Idea, a kind of retail superstore similar to Costco or IKEA, is targeted by six young activists to protest the animal cruelty in making the furniture sold in their store. They enter the store right before closing, hide until all the doors are locked and the customers are sent home, and then trash the place with animal blood and spray paint.

Kevin (Turlough Convery) is a security guard recently put on the night shift with his brother Jack (Aidan O’Hare). Kevin nearly lost his job after losing his temper with unruly customers. The night shift is his last chance to prove he doesn’t deserve to be fired.

After discovering the vandalism the activists left behind, Kevin and Jack confront them. However, a brutal accident sends Kevin over the edge. With Kevin no longer worried about losing his job, he begins hunting the activists and killing them one by one. Their only chance is to try and survive until the store opens in the morning.

From Canadian directors Anouk Whissell and Yoann-Karl Whissell also known as RKSS (Turbo Kid, Summer of ’84, We Are Zombies), Wake Up feels like a drama strewn together by a few moments of horror.

The film focuses more on Kevin struggling to keep his job while Jack succumbs to his vices while trying to keep Kevin in check. It also devotes an unbelievable amount of time to the activists destroying the store. The problem is they’re all stupid, boring, and forgettable.

Wake Up was written by Alberto Marini based on an original idea by Martin Soudan, but the problem is none of these activists have any depth. Some of them want to screw each other and many of them come from wealthy families, but they mostly come off as intolerable brats.

During their mission, even after the film you don’t know what they were trying to do besides trash everything, you’d think they’d try to be somewhat stealthy. Ideally, you would try to get in, vandalize to your heart’s content, and get out before anyone notices. These a-holes stop 20 minutes into the movie to have a damn food fight. Ethan (Benny O. Arther), the supposed activist leader, then says something along the lines of it’s okay to have fun while accomplishing the mission.

One of the female activists eventually slaps on a pair of rollerblades and their last hurrah is a paintball fight. It all feels like some backward heist planned out by a 13-year-old.

Even after Kevin starts killing the activists, Wake Up never really introduces any clever kills or adds any sort of tension to these young kids being hunted. There’s a moment in the bathroom where Karim (Tom Gould) is hiding from him in one of the stalls. Karim leaves his shoes in the stall for no reason, crawls under three stalls, and then gets a handmade spear javelin thrown into his back.

Most of the kills involve a knife stabbing someone in a predictable spot; the back, the gut, or the eye. Someone is slammed against a wall repeatedly until they just die. Somebody else gets choked. One dude gets stabbed and then his neck is broken. Every death feels run of the mill.

The most creative part of the film is when the remaining survivors are lured into a freezer to retrieve a wounded friend they thought was dead. When they arrive, neon paint is dumped on them and the lights go out. They’re then hunted by Kevin unable to see, but the audience sees everything because the paint has a black light effect.

The ending isn’t super satisfying either. None of the characters are likable, but even then the direction they go in is questionable. The final sequence is also bizarre like it was only done to make the filmmakers laugh.

Turbo Kid is an incredibly fun film, but RKSS has never really been able to make anything as good or as decent since. Wake Up could have been a ton of fun if the kills weren’t so dull and if the characters weren’t strictly one-layered assholes. Everything feels halfway developed here; the beginning of something worthwhile with a middle and end involving no imagination or creativity whatsoever.",5.0
852247,Problemista,"Isn’t it amazing how failures can often lead to unexpected successes? Those missteps frequently have a way of opening meaningful doors, even if it doesn’t seem that way at the time they occur. But how readily are we aware that such developments can occur? Such is the whirlwind experience of Alejandro Martinez (Julio Torres), a young, idealistic, inventive Salvadoran toy designer who emigrates to New York in search of a job in an incubator program at a major American toy manufacturer. But, to apply for the position, he must be present stateside, which means he needs a work visa to reside here long enough to make his pitch. That possibility seems to evaporate, though, when he loses his job as a client curator at a cryogenics company. Fortunately, however, as he’s making his exit from the workplace, he meets and befriends a flamboyant art critic (Tilda Swinton) upset with the way the cryogenics company is handling the care of her late partner (RZA), an eccentric artist known for specializing in paintings of eggs. To raise funds for the painter’s curation, she wants to stage an exhibition of his work but needs help to pull it off, which is where Alejandro enters the picture. He volunteers to assist with staging the show in exchange for her sponsorship so that he can obtain a new work visa to stay in the US. It sounds like a simple, straightforward arrangement, but, as he soon finds out, that’s far from the case, as he launches into a wild and crazy odyssey filled with any number of outlandish personal and professional incidents, many of them ludicrous and comical yet surprisingly beneficial. This debut feature from actor-writer-director Torres tells an unconventional yet hilarious and insightful story of commitment, empowerment and imagination filled with colorful characters and enigmatic situations. Its clever production design, imaginative cinematography, and inclusion of surreal and symbolic sequences makes for an edgy yet entertaining watch, an impressive first offering from the former Saturday Night Live staff writer. While there are some instances where the narrative tends to become a little too outrageously self-satisfied for its own good, the bulk of the film stays on course and features an array of fine performances from Torres, Swinton and a host of supporting players. “Problemista” was originally scheduled for release in summer 2023 but was delayed by the SAG-AFTRA strike. However, as this delightfully quirky offering shows, the wait was indeed worth it, as it often is for those who encounter seemingly endless snafus on the way to achieving their greatness. If you’re fond of the irreverent, as I am, you’ll get a kick out of this one, an engaging tale that both enlightens and entertains while giving your mind a lot to play with.",7.0
852247,Problemista,"I was drawn in to this one because it features Tilda Swinton, one of my favorite actresses. She is, in this movie too, an absolute power house of talent, and the sole reason to keep watching. 

Unfortunately, the movie is entirely unwatchable, as each and every main character, and quite a few of the secondary ones as well, is insufferable. This may be on purpose, I suspect it is, but I really need at least for either the protagonist to be likable, or in the case of an antihero, for the supporting cast to be likable. Here, I get neither. 

Now, there are clear overtones drawing a message about immigrants coming to the United States for work. The message being that they're incompetent infantile unlikable narcissistic habitual liars without a conscience.

Personally, I don't subscribe to this simplistic and clearly incorrect view. Surely, not all immigrants are like this, I'd wager a dwindling number would be. But I don't really fault the movie for offering this view, and it's not why I score it this low. I watch movies presenting viewpoints to which I don't subscribe all the time, and if they do it well and in a professional and engaging manner, I'll like the movie all the same. One example of this is ""Men,"" which presents a terribly nihilistic and misandrist theme, but it does so masterfully, and so I must (joyfully) cheer for it all the same.

This movie, however, is just awful. Its theme is hateful and its execution incompetent. I suspect the writer/director is as narcissistic and sociopathic as its characters. It has that vibe.

Although I couldn't stomach finishing this atrocity, I cannot give it one star. Tilda Swinton is too wonderful for that. And therefore, two stars. Avoid.",2.0

""Sometimes I Think About Dying tackles social anxiety and loneliness in a purposefully dull yet intriguing fashion. Lingering cinematography, atmospheric score, and a phenomenal Daisy Ridley somehow make it all work, but its uneventful, repetitive narrative won't be for everyone.""

Rating: B-",6.0
891933,Sometimes I Think About Dying,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

I really love “Sometimes I Think About Dying,” director Rachel Lambert‘s low-key, melancholy character piece about a socially awkward woman who has an unmet desire for human connection. The unhurried pacing and measured storytelling may be challenging for some viewers, but this little film that seems to be about nothing is actually rooted in depth and has a keen understanding of what it feels like to suffer with crippling social awkwardness.

Living in a small coastal town on the dreary Oregon coast, Fran (Daisy Ridley) spends much of her time alone and often daydreams about dying. She works at a drab office and quietly observes her more outgoing coworkers as they chat with each other and go about their daily routines. She describes herself as “not very interesting,” is quiet and reserved, isn’t very sociable, has no friends, and mostly keeps to herself. This shyness is often mistaken for aloofness, and most everyone steers clear of any interactions with her. Things change when the friendly and slightly awkward Robert (Dave Merheje) starts a job at the company, and he takes an interest in Fran. She’s afraid to give friendship a chance, but there’s something different about him that may just make Robert the first person whom she allows to really get to know her.

There isn’t a whole lot of plot, but Lambert manages to keep her film compelling. Her storytelling style is highly detailed, which gives a warmth to the bleak tone. Nothing feels forced. Lambert paints a dreary portrait of humanity, but does so with wit, style, charm, and humor. There’s so much subtlety in what’s left unspoken, and the film shows us Fran’s professional and personal life, but never tells us what to feel.

The film is well cast from top to bottom, including Parvesh Cheena, Marcia DeBonis, and Megan Stalter, who add a lot of amusement as Fran’s office mates, and Merheje and Ridley feel charmingly authentic. Right down to her body language, from avoiding eye contact to a slouched posture when her character is feeling uncomfortable, Ridley wholly embodies what it must feel like to be Fran. It’s a skilled, effective performance, and one with few spoken words.

It may sound like a hard sell to sit through a movie that’s focused on a lead character who suffers from severe social anxiety, but “Sometimes I Think About Dying” is a good, simple story that’s told well. It’s a captivating film that gracefully expresses the need for human connection while being unable to rid yourself of debilitating melancholia.",8.0
891933,Sometimes I Think About Dying,"the best performance of daisy ridley, hands down. however, the movie's premise was obviously more suitable for a short movie and it lacked energy at some scenes. i still enjoyed it and i loved how well shot it was, the scenery was extremely beautiful.",8.0
891933,Sometimes I Think About Dying,"""Fran"" (Daisy Ridley) likes to keep herself to herself. She's very much on the periphery of things at work and goes home to her favourite cottage cheese and bed by 10.15 most evenings. The arrival of ""Robert"" (Dave Merheje) shakes things up a little when his request for some office provisions leads to a trip to the cinema to see ""Departure"" (2015). Though it could never be described as racy, what now ensues watches the two get a little close and a better acquainted. She reveals to him that as she looks from her cubicle window at the huge cranes loading and unloading the ships, she imagines herself swinging from one of them - and not in the way a child might! A chance meeting with the recently retired ""Carol"" (Marcia DeBonis) in a diner might help ""Fran"" recalibrate her priorities though! This is a far cry from anything Ridley has done thus far, and shows her as an actor of considerable versatility. The writing works quite well here, too. Sparingly used between the main characters but more plentifully used to illustrate the banal nature of her life at work - especially with boss ""Isobel"" (Megan Stalter) who has verbal diarrhoea in just about every way you can imagine. The story takes quite an interesting look at those (slightly) later in life who are in a rut and content to remain so but I'm afraid this whole scenario doesn't really make for gripping cinema. Indeed, at times the director seems content to leave us with only the superficial glimpse of the characters and together with the bleak and dull nature of the lighting, creates an ennui all of it's own. It's not so much that nothing really happens, it's that I wasn't really bothered either way if it did or didn't. The whole thing is all just a bit too lacklustre. It's fine, this film, but not much more.",6.0
891933,Sometimes I Think About Dying,"Rachel Lambert's ""Sometimes I Think About Dying"" exists in that peculiar liminal space between captivating and tedious—a film rescued from its own narrative thinness by extraordinary performances and meticulous visual storytelling.

Daisy Ridley's Fran is a masterclass in minimalist acting. As an office worker whose interior life dwarfs her external expression, Ridley communicates volumes through microexpressions and body language. A slight shift in posture, a barely perceptible eye movement—these become seismic emotional events in Ridley's hands. Dave Merheje's Robert provides the perfect counterbalance, his extroverted warmth creating a gravitational pull that both attracts and terrifies Fran.

Lambert's direction shines in her visual translation of introversion. The camera often observes Fran from above or at a distance, perfectly capturing both her self-consciousness and her remove from the world around her. These compositions aren't just aesthetically interesting; they're emotional architecture, building a visual language for the invisible experience of social anxiety.

The Oregon coast setting, with its perpetual gray skies and misty landscapes, becomes less a backdrop than an extension of Fran's inner weather. The region's gloomy beauty provides perfect environmental shorthand for a character whose mind constantly drifts toward darkness despite moments of startling beauty.

What prevents the film from reaching greatness is its meandering screenplay. Scenes linger past their natural conclusion, and the narrative occasionally loses momentum, particularly in the second half. Yet there's something almost appropriate about this pacing—introversion itself isn't efficient or economical, but measured and cautious.

""Sometimes I Think About Dying"" isn't making grand philosophical statements about the human condition or the nature of introvert-extrovert attraction. It's simply observing one specific connection with uncommon visual intelligence and performance depth. The film's power lies not in what it says but in how attentively it watches.",7.0

""The Book of Clarence certifies Jeymes Samuel as a do-it-all in filmmaking. Whether through his stylized direction, thought-provoking satirical screenplay, or bold soundtrack, the filmmaker once again delivers a highly original, genuinely hilarious blend of genres and tones, and a captivating spiritual exploration of the protagonist.

Fortunate as well to have an absolutely superb cast with LaKeith Stanfield commanding the troops, delivering an impressively all-round performance. It lacks better tonal balance and more unpredictability, the latter being destroyed by an unnecessary opening sequence.

Glad to know it will be released on the big screen, which is where I definitely recommend everyone to go and experience this piece of guaranteed entertainment.""

976584,The Book of Clarence,"If you watched and know the style of Jeymes Samuel as writer and director you know what to expect (The Harder they Fall, They Die by Down). 

It tells the story of a man that is a con artist that aims to be a new Messiah, in the age of Jesus (and alongside him - 3 days behind), but not a classical Jesus or a new correct etiology one, but one in a black Jerusalem.

It have some interesting messages more to end, shows Romans as the whites, and do not mention proper Jews - it also doesn't choose to what it aims as a movie, comedy or drama putting some comic sequences and references of Marijuana (that was used already in that time, a certain thing, accidental or not). 

LaKeith Stanfield is the star of the movie and does well his role and multiplicity of his character. But this isn't enough to make this a good movie.

976584,The Book of Clarence,"""Clarence"" (LaKeith Stanfield) and brother ""Elijah"" (RJ Cyler) come off worst in a chariot race with Mary Magdalene (Teyana Taylor) and that lets us know that he is now in hock to the nasty ""Jedediah the Terrible"" (Eric Kofi Abrefa) for a great deal of money. It quite literally is his money or his life. He has a relationship, of sorts, with ""Varinia"" who might be able to intercede with her menacing brother on his behalf, but meantime ""Clarence"" hits on an idea of his own. He is aware of the buzz in the community around the impending arrival of the Messiah, indeed his twin brother ""Thomas"" is an apostle (with a silent t). How hard can it be to fake some tricks to convince the gullible population that he can cure the sick or raise the dead? Up until now, this all has a rather ""Monty Python"" meets ""Ben Hur"" feel to it. It's amiable and well enough paced. Sadly, though, slightly more sincere and half-baked religious elements begin to kick in to the characters a little too earnestly, and the comedic elements are increasingly supplanted by a rather bitty narrative that sees the hitherto quite entertaining ""Clarence"" begin to take himself just a little too seriously and the entire enterprise stalls. Omar Sy delivers well as Barabbas - though I think maybe he ought to have been called Achilles; Benedict Cumberbatch looks more like Robert Powell than he does and the best scene by far comes from Alfre Woodard's lively interpretation of the Virgin Mary. It has it's moments, but is a bit of a mess of a film that starts off engagingly but is far too long and just sort of peters out.",6.0
1225377,The Mouse Trap,"I was initially apprehensive about watching The Mouse Trap, given the recent trend of rushed public domain movies that have often been boring and unimaginative. However, when Mickey Mouse became public domain in the form of Steamboat Willie and this film was announced, I was curious to see just how exploitative it might be.

The Mouse Trap is undeniably a low-budget slasher film, and it wears that label proudly. The film leans heavily on the Mickey Mouse character and Disney-related puns, almost to the point of overkill. The film’s one-dimensional storyline doesn’t do much to add depth or coherence, leaving viewers with more questions than answers as to the motivation behind the carnage.

The overuse of Disney references, while initially amusing, quickly becomes tiresome. The film seems to rely on the novelty of incorporating a beloved public domain character into a slasher context, but this novelty wears off as the movie progresses. For instance, the antagonist’s costume—a grotesque parody of the classic Steamboat Willie design—loses its impact after the first few appearances, becoming more of a distraction than a source of genuine horror.

That said, there’s an undeniable sense that the cast and crew had a great time making this movie, and that enthusiasm does shine through in the performances and the film's visual style. The actors, despite the flimsy script, seem to be fully committed to their roles, bringing a sense of fun and energy to the production. 

The visual style of the film, while not groundbreaking, is creative within the constraints of its budget. The filmmakers clearly took inspiration from classic horror tropes and combined them with a playful, almost satirical approach.

Overall, The Mouse Trap may not be a masterpiece by any stretch, but it has its moments of entertainment. While the film’s reliance on Disney puns and the overuse of the Mickey Mouse character can be grating, the clear enjoyment of the cast and crew adds a certain appeal. It’s a film that’s fun for one watch, especially for those curious about how far a public domain slasher can push the boundaries, but it likely won’t hold up to repeated viewings. If you’re in the mood for a campy, low-budget horror flick with a unique twist, The Mouse Trap might be worth a look—just don’t expect too much beyond the novelty.",1.0

She quite quickly determines to track him down and next thing she is in his cab. It's not like she's a cougar nor he a womaniser - they are just two older people who click at the idea of something a bit ""extra"" at the end of their rain soaked day. The largest bottle of wine you've ever seen is duly produced and, well you can guess what's on the cards. Except? Well you can also guess that things are not going to go to plan either - and we are given a few subtle clues along the way to manage our expectations as this really quite entertainingly mischievous story develops. Farhadpour is really engaging as she charms her new beau and there's a lovely, soft, chemistry between the two as most of the plot unfolds in her house as they take care not to involve the dreaded morality police who might arrive and punish them - even at their advanced age - for being alone in her home together! Indeed, what also helps this work is the gentle way in which it makes some pretty hefty points. About age, assumptions about age - true, but it also takes a broader look at a society that still treats women as less free citizens thanks their testicled counterparts. Most of all thought it's really quite funny and delivers us a message of confidence, shyness, optimism and hope tempered with some dark humour - especially at the end.

The script appeared poorly written, leading me to wonder if it was originally crafted in another country or if the dubbing was simply comical. The attempt to transform the film into something more than it was resulted in a chaotic narrative involving a poodle and a puppy, which ultimately made it a poorly executed and disappointing experience.

1013154,Hard Truths,"As many of us can attest, the strains of daily living and the ghosts of our past can take their toll on us in myriad ways, leaving us frazzled, frustrated, depressed and perpetually angry. We may not like the emergence of those outcomes, as they can effectively isolate us from others, including those we’re thought to care most about. But those conditions can become so overwhelming that we can’t cope nor allow well-meaning others to step in and help us. Such is the case for fifty-something middle class British housewife and mother, Pansy (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), who constantly complains, yells and criticizes everybody and everything around her, including her hard-working husband, Curtley (David Webber), and withdrawn 22-year-old son, Moses (Tuwaine Barrett). Curtley and Moses have been so beaten down by her irate nature that they no longer put up a fight with her, reconciled to her unendingly ornery persona. In fact, the only family member who tries to understand Pansy is her younger sister, Chantelle (Michele Austin), who worries for her sibling’s state of mind and increasingly shaky mental health. It’s never made completely clear why Pansy acts out as she does, especially in terms of the exacting standards to which she holds others for everything, though there are hints that much of her relentless discontent is rooted in the pain of a past she can’t bring herself to relinquish. Some onlookers also contend that her behavior is little more than a way to attract the attention and sympathy of others, but there comes a point where their patience and tolerance run out, prompting them to give up and leave her to stew in her own anguish, a solution that brings her no closer to meaningful resolution. As with many of his other film projects, writer-director Mike Leigh again presents viewers with a character study of an individual who fruitlessly wrestles with her circumstances without direction and ultimately comes no closer to resolving them than where she was when the opening credits rolled. Consequently, some may find this a frustrating, repetitive cinematic experience, yet, to its credit, the film also paints a realistic, candid portrait to which many of us can probably quietly relate. In telling Pansy’s story, the filmmaker concocts an intriguing mix of comedy and drama, though the laughs generated here may prove to be not so funny as the protagonist’s saga plays out, particularly in terms of the impact she has on others and herself. To that end then, some might argue that “Hard Truths” offers us no easy answers or plausible solutions, but isn’t that often the case where working through life’s hard truths is concerned? While the character development here could stand to be a little stronger at times (especially in terms of back story) and some ancillary narrative threads could have been easily eliminated – elements not uncommon in Leigh’s pictures – this is arguably the director’s most intimate, heartfelt and accessible release. In large part that’s thanks to the film’s National Board of Review Award-winning screenplay and its excellent performances, most notably Jean-Baptiste’s award-worthy portrayal, one that has deservedly earned her BAFTA and Critics Choice Award nominations. Given the foregoing, this may not be the easiest picture to watch, but it’s sure to provide us with much to reflect upon both for others – and ourselves – as we seek to figure how to assess life and the challenges it presents us.",8.0
1013154,Hard Truths,"<em>'Hard Truths'</em> features superb performances and an extremely hearty narrative, it's genuinely one of the saddest films I've seen in a long while; these type of real, gritty stories are always more impactful to me than the more manufactured drama (not that that's bad).

Marianne Jean-Baptiste is outstanding as Pansy, a character that is on the surface quite unlikeable but due to her performance as well as smart writing it is actually easy to still care for the character; it's clear why she is the way she is. Michele Austin is also terrific, I couldn't put my finger on where I remembered her from - TV's <em>'This Is Going to Hurt'</em>.

David Webber and Tuwaine Barrett are effective in their roles too, arguably not difficult characters to play but I did feel for them both. Ani Nelson, Sophia Brown and even Jonathan Livingstone manage to stand out too, albeit comparatively minorly versus Jean-Baptiste and Austin.

As saddening as this film can be, there is also a fair bit of comedy thrown in there - most, if not all, of which is funny. That scene with Jean-Baptiste and Gary Beadle sticks out, even if Beadle's character is rather over the top. The blend of humour and serious is perfect.

For the third week running (weirdly, having not ever happened before), I got to see two films at the cinema back-to-back. This week, it was this and Drew Hancock's <em>'Companion'</em>. Safe to say, two very different movies! Highly enjoyed them both though.",9.0
1013154,Hard Truths,"Marianne Jean-Baptiste turns in a splendid performance here as the troubled ""Pansy"". She's married to ""Curtley"" (David Webber) and mother to ""Moses"" (Tiwaine Barrett) but suffice to say she's not an happy woman. Her glass is most definitely half empty as she delivers monologue after monologue of depressing observations about the decline of society as she picks a fight with just about everyone and anyone she can - including her family. That family also includes her more upbeat hairdresser sister ""Chantelle"" (Michele Austin) and it's through that familial link that we start to discover just what might be driving this obsessively destructive behaviour. It's an observation of a few day in their lives, with limited information available to us before an even less well defined conclusion, but it does provoke thoughts on the importance of family and the perniciousness of grief and mental illness on not just those who suffer themselves, but on those who suffer by association. To that end, there's also quite a touching effort from Barrett as a son who is reserved and may well have learning difficulties of his own as he walks the streets, headphones glued to his head, cutting a rather lonely figure. The dialogue is intense, either delivering the wittily angry rants of ""Pansy"" or the more convivial ones of her sibling and her young daughters more intent on living the joys of life. It doesn't hang around and is, at times, both an entertaining and difficult watch as it showcases an actor who can invoke a gamut of emotions seemingly effortlessly. I could have done with just a little more context as we are left a bit rudderless at times, but it's still a formidable effort from MJ-B that's well worth an hour and half.",7.0

**Bottom Line:** There always will be garbage on our planet as long as we humans exist and there always will be products to sell as long as humans exist and of course seller companies and salesmen will do their best to sell as much as possible, because it's what they do.

1192209,Arca de Noé,"Two musical mice - ""Vini"" and ""Tom"" are taking a well earned nap one afternoon when they hear God having a bit of a rant at his old pal Noah. He's had enough of his project Earth and wants to start again, so tells the man to get building. A ship big enough to hold two of each creature then he's going to send enough rain to wash the slate clean so animals from far and wide are invited - by airmail - whilst he sets about building his ark. Now this boat isn't quite as robust as the one Russell Crowe built in 2014, but after a few shenanigans the critters are assembled and down comes the inundation. The flaw in all of this meticulous planning is that the menacing lion, backed by his henchmen, is soon intent on raiding what little supplies that vessel caries before proceeding to an exceptionally fresh all you can eat buffet. Can the intrepid little mice - now joined by ""Nina"" do anything to thwart this grand design long enough for the dove of peace to struggle through the wind and the rain in the search of land? There's nothing remotely religious about this story, it's just an amiable animation that characterises a few jungle creatures and uses some forgettable musical numbers to deliver a sort of ""Ark's Got Talent"". It's probably half an hour longer than it needs to be, but when it gets going it doesn't hang about delivering a tale of friendship and determination, whilst reminding us that bullies are usually the most cowardly of any group. Sure, it's a bit derivative and it certainly reminded me of the ""Lion King"" at times, but it's harmless family fun that will be fine to leave the kids in front of the telly with at Christmas.",6.0
1016848,The Front Room,"I recently watched the film ""The Front Room,"" which stars Brandy Norwood in a role that marks her return to thriller and horror genres since ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer."" The movie takes you on a wild ride with a deranged mother-in-law who claims her actions are in the name of Jesus Christ, but in reality, she is mentally unstable.

Despite its low budget and odd script, ""The Front Room"" is a captivating watch as you witness the disturbing antics of this non-biological mother-in-law towards the protagonist, especially after the birth of a baby. Her behavior, from her laugh to her speech, is so repulsive that you may find yourself wanting to intervene and have her arrested.

While the film may not be a masterpiece, it is also not without merit. It offers a twisted and entertaining experience, showcasing the extent of the mother-in-law's insanity.",3.0
1016848,The Front Room,"Kathryn Hunter tuns in quite an entertaining performance here as the truly odious and manipulative ""Solange"" but the rest of this is pretty weak. It all starts with teacher ""Belinda"" (Brandy Norwood) and her lawyer husband ""Norman"" (Andrew Burnap) expecting a baby and struggling to make ends meet in their new home. His father dies, and at the funeral he learns that the terms of the will sort of require them to take in his stepmother for what's left of her life. She's tiny, walks with two big sticks, and looks like she's already in God's waiting room - but ""Norman"" loathes the woman. ""Belinda"", on the other hand, deicides that the cash on offer is too good to turn down and so... What now ensues is just a mess. The characterisation of ""Belinda"" has all the depth of an Ethiopian river in July and her drippy husband - who just reminded me of a grown up ""Harry Potter"" the whole time - struggle to make any impact on a story that just doesn't deliver. There's no menace, no sense of peril, some adult nappies and as script that came straight from the ""Janet & John"" book of elementary thriller writing. It's actually quite a tasteless and an annoyingly repetitive watch with shades of ""Rosemary's Baby"" to it - but very shady shades. It's fodder for Halloween season, and after a few beers late at night on the television might bear watching just for the efforts of Hunter, but otherwise this is completely forgettable stuff.",5.0

Noises in the woods unsettle them, but they see nothing. Suddenly, though, one of their number is taken and the leader ""Adem"" (Chuku Modu) must make some difficult choices to ensure the survival of both his son and of his pregnant wife. The denseness of the Scottish forestry along with some creative use of light, shadow and audio goes some way to keep the film interesting but the plot itself is really weak and the actors - perfect teeth, skin, leather clothing that wouldn't look out of place at a gay pride gathering - all deprive the thing of any sense of menace or grittiness. It's difficult to watch without thinking the production caravan is just three feet out of shot! The redeeming feature may be an impressibly natural performance from Safia Oakley-Green (""Beyah"") but I'm afraid for the most part, I struggled to remain engaged and the ending, well that was just rushed and a little disappointing too. I would still suggest you watch it, if you get the opportunity - but on the television is fine and don't expect to be scared.",6.0

Frankly speaking, the movie Uranus2324 has used up all my trips to the cinema in the past few years. It will definitely be an unforgettable memory for me in my life.
 
I believe that most people are like me, looking for love with deep desire by travelling to the parallel universes with Kath and Lin. Love is beautiful no matter which time and space we are in. Even though it always comes with tears of sorrow when lovers have to be apart in the end, we still want to find the right person in our lives, don’t we?
 
Most of all, I was surprised while seeing many audience stayed in their seats until the theme song “Still missing you” had ended. I’m touched, as I’ve rarely seen such a scene before.
 
Thanks to Velcurve Studio and all the other members of the movie production team for giving us such a great film. This brand-new film, produced from a female perspective (female-to-female romance), is completely different from other Thai films I’ve watched. Meanwhile, I also appreciate CAI CHANG Asia for releasing it in Taiwan.
 
As an international fan, “Uranus2324” is one way for me to be in close contact with FreenBecky and support them as well. Therefore, I cherish the opportunity to watch it so much. Undoubtedly, we can see that these two girls successfully portrayed both main characters in the film after putting in a lot of time and effort. It is evident that they have made even more progress with each new work.
 
My heart is still missing you, my Uranus, my lovely girls.

1154223,Tigres et Hyènes,"Whilst not exactly original, Hunting with Tigers offers enough worthwhile content, to fit comfortably, into the French action crime thriller genre.

This film delivers plenty of action with a certain vibe that's hard to define in words but feels, inherently French. Its kind of gritty, earthy but also has a certain flair and style, that's very much evident, in this film. Most notably, the courthouse shoot out, which is central to this film's story of loyalty and honour (of a kind).

Characterisations follow a similar trajectory. Its hard hitting, no nonsense stuff with tough guys doing tough guy things. Its nicely balanced with a sense of comradery and jokery fellowship.  

On the downside there are a few conspicuous plot holes and it all feels a little preposterous but again, that could be said to be part of the fun.  

In summary, a solid, middle of the road, French crime action thriller. Something the French seem to excel at. Definitively worth a look.",7.0
1128650,誤判,"In the Hong Kong action thriller The Prosecutor, a young man named Ma Ka-kit lives with his Uncle Ma in a low-income home. He rents out his address in an effort to make some extra money, but he receives a package containing a kilogram of cocaine and gets arrested for drug smuggling. Chan Kwok-wing, the second defendant in the drug smuggling case, is found to be the one who purchased Ma Ka-kit’s address.

Ma Ka-kit (Mason Fung) is convinced by his defense lawyer Li Sze-man ( Shirley Chan) and legal executive Au Pak-man (Julian Cheung) to plead guilty to reduce his sentence. But once the case reaches leniency court, Ma Ka-kit is sentenced to 27 years in prison while Chan Kwok-wing (Locker Lam) is acquitted. Now, Ma Ka-kit’s fate rests in the hands of Fok Chi-ho (Donnie Yen), a former narcotics police detective turned public prosecutor.

Written by Edmond Wong (Ip Man 1-4, The Monkey King: Havoc in Heaven’s Palace), The Prosecutor is inspired by the real case that transpired in 2016. The film is also directed and produced by Donnie Yen (who also directed Sakra).

Fok Chi-ho is brought to the DOJ or Department of Justice under the tutelage of pupil master Bao Ding (Kent Cheng) and is told flat out upon arrival that the DOJ typically leaves decision-making in the hands of chief prosecutor Yeung Dit-lap (Francis Ng).

Surprisingly, Donnie Yen was hesitant to accept this role since most of the action was injected into the film once he signed on. Yen wasn’t familiar with legal dramas initially, but worked with Edmond Wong and his stunt team to create a film that is dramatically engaging with dynamically unique action sequences.

In foreign martial arts films, it’s often that the action is great but the story and acting are pure trash or lackluster at best. But The Prosecutor is a thrilling and engrossing drama first highlighted by its action. Donnie Yen turns 62 this year, but his martial arts is as hard-hitting and breathtaking as ever. What works in The Prosecutor’s favor is a solid script from Edmond Wong and Yen being surrounded by a talented cast.

There’s an ongoing conflict between how the legal system and DOJ specifically operate and how Fok Chi-ho is as a new prosecutor. Fok fights hard for Ma Ka-kit and this one case specifically solely because he’s a young man with a bright future who is stuck thanks to his practically nonexistent relationship with money. Everyone at the DOJ is constantly ribbing Fok over Fok’s troublesome mindset of giving the little guy a fair shake despite whether or not it’s normal protocol. It’s essentially the government with endless wealth at its disposal and a cut-and-dry mentality versus the financially destitute underdog.

The Prosecutor isn’t overloaded with action but features several memorable sequences that should be considered some of Donnie Yen’s best. The opening is a drug bust that shows Fok on his last big outing as a police officer. He gets a hold of a police shield and demolishes everyone as the camera shifts to a first-person POV. Donnie Yen throws in a few dropkicks for good measure.

Once Fok shifts careers, former subordinate Lee King-wai (MC Cheung Tin-fu), takes over as police inspector. The two collaborate on an insane action sequence in an alley that features Lee King-wai doing MMA takedowns not unlike what Yen did in Flash Point. The scene is highlighted by Yen Tokyo Drifting a white car into the tiny alley flawlessly followed by jumping out of the car and beating everyone down with a hockey stick.

There’s also the club sequence that’s already eye-catching thanks to its dynamic lighting, but features some crazy drone camera shots and Fok holding off 100 men on his own. The absolute best sequence in the film is the subway finale. Seeing so much bone-crunching action in a tiny moving space is jaw-droppingly great.

My initial desire upon hearing about The Prosecutor is that Donnie Yen would shout OBJECTION! or OVERRULED! regularly and then he’d beat up criminals with a flurry of punches, no less than 17 dropkicks, and top it off with an emphatic suplex. That’s basically what you get with The Prosecutor, but it’s also surprisingly well-written with solid acting from an all-around superb cast.",8.0
647245,Reagan,"Recently, I had the opportunity to watch the movie ""Reagan,"" a captivating biography centered around the life of former President Ronald Reagan. Dennis Quaid takes on the role of the iconic president, portraying a two-hour love story dedicated to the American people.

The film delves deep into Reagan's entire life, beginning from his childhood with poignant flashbacks that reveal his struggles with bullying and his mother's unwavering determination for him to stand up for himself. From his days as a movie actor to dealing with a failed marriage and the loss of a child at birth, Reagan's story unfolds with a strong focus on his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

The narrative follows Reagan's journey as he rises from governor to senator and eventually becomes the President of the United States. Throughout his political career, Reagan remains steadfast in his faith, never wavering even in the face of challenges such as his mother's passing and meeting his wife, Nancy.

The movie beautifully portrays Nancy Reagan as an incredible and loving woman, showcasing her unwavering support for her husband and her compassion towards everyone she encounters. The focus remains on Reagan's story, omitting the extensive details of Nancy's tenure as the First Lady.

Despite some critics' harsh reviews, the film's well-written script and engaging pace make for an immersive viewing experience. It effectively captures Reagan's struggles during his presidency, including the threat of impeachment, alongside his significant achievements such as the fall of the Berlin Wall and collaborations with world leaders like Margaret Thatcher.

While some may find fault in Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Reagan, feeling that he falls short of capturing the essence of the former president, the film's strong writing compensates for any casting missteps. The actress portraying Nancy Reagan, on the other hand, delivers a standout performance that adds depth to the scenes involving Reagan.

The movie tastefully acknowledges other prominent political figures like Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and George H.W. Bush, without overshadowing Reagan's narrative. It successfully presents Reagan's historical significance without delving into unnecessary controversies or distractions.

Additionally, the film delves into the poignant aspect of Ronald Reagan's battle with Alzheimer's disease, shedding light on the challenges this illness poses to individuals and their families. It portrays the emotional toll it takes on President Reagan and his loved ones, highlighting the profound impact of the disease on his later years. Through this portrayal, the movie offers a glimpse into the personal struggles faced by Reagan as he navigated the complexities of Alzheimer's, adding a touching and humanizing layer to his remarkable life story.

Overall, ""Reagan"" offers a breathtaking portrayal of a historical figure, allowing the audience to connect with Reagan's journey without being bogged down by excessive political intricacies. It serves as a compelling tribute to the enduring legacy of former President Ronald Reagan.

647245,Reagan,"Reagan is a biopic that attempts to portray the life and legacy of Ronald Reagan, featuring Dennis Quaid in the titular role. My experience watching the film was a mix of nostalgia and critique, as it covers Reagan's journey from his early years to his presidency, all narrated by Jon Voight a retired KGB agent.

Quaid's performance is commendable; he captures Reagan's charm and mannerisms effectively. The film highlights key moments, such as his near-assassination and his relationship with Nancy Reagan, which added emotional depth. However, I found the film's pacing slow and its 135-minute runtime excessive, making it feel drawn out at times.

Critically, the film has faced backlash for its overly glorified portrayal of Reagan, often glossing over significant controversies like the Iran-Contra scandal. While I appreciated the nostalgic elements and the depiction of California's landscapes, I felt the movie lacked a balanced perspective on Reagan's presidency.

Overall, Reagan offers an engaging look at a complex figure but falls short of delivering a comprehensive narrative. For those familiar with his era, it provides a sentimental journey, but it may leave others wanting more depth and accuracy.

1207830,Gracie & Pedro: Pets to the Rescue,"It's moving day for the family and with their furniture safely en route to Salt Lake City, the four head to the airport with their beloved pets. ""Gracie"" is a rather snooty dog and ""Pedro"" a street-smart cat who are in their cage going through the baggage process at the airport when they have one of their many spats. Next thing, they are tumbling amongst the conveyor belts, and well - they clearly are not getting onto the plane. Now they must try and use their guile, and a few new friends, to find out just how they can make the trip themselves and reunite with their dinner. They don't really like one another but after an altercation with a few savvy airport rats, have to learn to work together else they will end up in the pound - or even worse! Driven on by a pair of tenacious pursuers whom they assume are from the city authorities, off they set on a series of escapades. It's all fairly standard summer family fayre, this film, with decent animation and a couple of principal characters that gradually impart the virtues of inter-reliance, trust and of always keeping your collar on! No, you will not remember watching it afterwards, it's not a story packed with jeopardy or innovation, but there's plenty of action, a little sarcastic wit from the dialogue and some fun in a fairground for the denouement. It probably doesn't need to be seen in a cinema, but it's perfectly watchable.",6.0
977262,Ezra,"Director Tony Goldwyn‘s “Ezra” is a surprisingly heartfelt family drama that manages to be both funny and emotional in all the right ways. While it can sometimes feel too pedestrian, the story blends a road trip narrative with themes of family dynamics, personal trauma, and the unconditional love between a father and son.

Max (Bobby Cannavale) is a stand-up comedian and a father to Ezra (William A. Fitzgerald), a young boy on the autism spectrum. Devoted to his son, Max is fiercely protective of his unique qualities while remaining adamant about not “fixing” him because he believes Ezra is perfect as he is. But when forced to make a tough choice about the boy ‘s future, Max acts rashly, taking Ezra on a cross-country journey without his ex-wife Jenna’s (Rose Byrne) permission. This impulsive move creates both tension and heartfelt moments, as it forces Max to confront the consequences of his actions and the depths of his love for his son.

What sets the film apart is its authentic, raw portrayal of autism (the script is written by Tony Spiridakis, whose own experiences with an autistic son give the story an undeniable sense of realism). Fitzgerald (who is also on the spectrum) interacts with a world in a way that feels incredibly true to life because it is. The film captures the little things, like Ezra’s struggles with physical touch and his love for puzzles and memorization, without ever feeling exploitative. This is a film that doesn’t just shine a light on the challenges of autism, but exposes a world of nuance and individuality. You could say it’s educational in that way.

Cannavale’s performance as a deeply flawed father who’s totally devoted to his son is impressive. I didn’t know the actor had this much range, and he’s quite good. His character’s anger-management issues and rash decisions add a layer of complexity but it’s clear that every wrong step he takes is driven by love that isn’t always expressed in the healthiest way. Byrne provides a grounding balance to the chaos, portraying a character who is the voice of reason, and Robert De Niro’s role as Max’s father, Stan, is written in a way that’s more meaningful than a series of platitudes that often surround a dad trying to make amends for his past failures. Stan’s attempts to connect with Ezra and support his son are touching, and De Niro’s performance adds a depth to the family dynamics that feels earned and real.

The film strikes a perfect balance between drama and humor. There are moments of missteps where you’ll cringe at Max’s choices, but there’s never any doubt about his fierce, unwavering love for his son. This father-son relationship is at the emotional center of the film and serves as a reminder of how love can be messy, complicated, but also transformative.

“Ezra” is a story about family and how love isn’t always perfect. It blends humor and heart so well, providing a funny and moving look at fatherhood, redemption, and the bond between generations.

1229349,热辣滚烫,"Compared to Jia Ling’s previous work, there has been a significant improvement.",
1229349,热辣滚烫,"""Le Ying"" (Ling Jia) is a larger lass who has little success with anything save for half-drinking cola and sleeping for most of the day. She's been left a flat by her grandmother but her soon to be divorced sister ""Dou Dou"" (Zi Yang) needs some property if she is to be able to continue sending her daughter to private school. After initially agreeing to a transfer, a barney ensues and she storms out determined to find somewhere of her own to live. That means a job. Discipline. She gets a job in a BBQ joint for a boss who's a bit of a lecher, but she can deal with him. It's he who sends her to fetch some cigarettes from his car and that's where she rather curiously encounters ""Hao Kun"" (Jiayin Lei) who is a boxing coach at a gym round the corner. He's not having much success recruiting new clients so she agrees to be one. Now, on the face of it, she's not the most likely of boxers, but what now ensues sees her face a series of challenges that make her think deeply about who she is and who she wants to become. This reality check is only exacerbated by an appearance on her sister's rather comically cynical television talent show that makes ""X Factor"" look like ""Mastermind"" (though it does feature quite an entertaining strop between the panellists). The story itself meanders along a bit too slowly - it doesn't need to be over two hours long, but there can be no denying the effort put in by Ling Jia as her character comes to an empowering degree of self-realisation. It's a bit stereotypical, I suppose, but it's also quite frank and entertaining. It's can be funny, a little poignant and there's just the merest hint of chemistry between the two boxers. I doubt you'll remember it for long, and the ending is a bit of a muddle, but it is worth a watch.",7.0
1141182,Die Alone,"Die Alone is one of those boutique films that comes along every now and again, where they get it right.

A decent helping of originality has gone into this film. Its script is well above average, as are the performances from the cast, in this rather touchingly quirky take on what is essentially a walking dead, style film.

I could find little to criticise, given this is clearly produced on a limited budget. What is lacks in dollars it makes up for in pure creativity. 

In summary, Die Alone is original, creative, oddly touching and shows, yet again, how talent and innovation triumphs over big budgets, every single time. Most definitely worth a look.",7.0
1032472,Snerting,"Many of us have experienced situations in life that have left us wondering “what might have been,” especially in matters of romance. And sometimes these scenarios can linger in our psyche for a lifetime, gnawing away at us and potentially leaving us with feelings of profound regret. Some of us, though, vow not to succumb to such disappointment, taking action to resolve these matters before it’s too late. Such is the case of a 75-year-old Icelandic man (Egill Ólafsson) suffering from the onset of dementia during the early days of the COVID pandemic. With the clock running out, his health faltering and stringent quarantine measures being put into place, he’s nevertheless desperate to learn what happened to the love of his life, a beautiful young Japanese immigrant (Kōki) he met 51 years earlier while his younger self (Pálmi Kormákur) was living in London. After a brief, passionate love affair, she suddenly vanished and returned to Japan without an explanation, an event that has haunted him ever since. He decides to search for her before health and travel restrictions prevent him from doing so, an impulsive journey that takes him back to London and then on to Japan to find out what happened. To say much more would reveal too much about the secrets driving this compelling romance/mystery, suffice it to say, though, that the protagonist’s tale is an engaging one, told through an absorbing story line deftly peppered with flashbacks to different points in the characters’ lives. In telling this story of love and intrigue, writer-director Baltasar Kormákur presents a colorful mix of genuinely original characters in a variety of circumstances not depicted on the big screen before. Admittedly, the pacing could stand to be stepped up in a few places (an outcome that could have been accomplished with some judicious editing), and further enhancement of the back story and character development might have provided more meaningful depth to the overall narrative. However, given the captivating trail of bread crumbs that the filmmaker doles out for viewers, this heartfelt release leaves audience members continually wondering what’s coming next. And, in doing so, the picture serves up a number of little-known, eye-opening cultural revelations that add spice and diversity to a genre that seldom ventures into such unfamiliar territory, an objective carried out with a tremendous sense of warmth without becoming unduly sentimental. In my view, this is the picture that the vastly overrated “Past Lives” (2023) was trying to be (and could have been), one that entertains, enlightens and educates all at the same time while providing audiences with a tale that’s sure to tug at the heartstrings – and shows us how “what might have been” could have actually been brought into being.",8.0
1032472,Snerting,"Anyone else think that Egill Ólafsson turned slowly into Lord Olivier in this drama? He's ""Kristófer"" - an elderly Icelander whom, on the cusp of global lockdown, flies to London to retrace some steps from his earlier life in the 1970s. Then he (Palmi Kormákur) was a disillusioned student at the LSE who jacks it all in to go and work in a small Japanese restaurant in Soho. He's an handsome and engaging lad who soon fits into the family infrastructure of the place, willing to learn their language and how to prepare some of their speciality dishes - and also willing to befriend daughter ""Miko"" (Kôki). As the story develops, we see a burgeoning love story set against a backdrop of a family that hastily left their homeland after the end of the war, and that have some fairly traumatic links with the events that led, ultimately, to it's conclusion. The production knits some early seventies music into a storyline that also suggests ""Kristófer"" hasn't too much time left on his own clock as he uses virtually no information to see if he can track down his former love. I suppose the romantic elements to this are a little on the predictable side, but director Baltasar Kormâkur manages to elicit from both versions of the man, from the impressive young Kôki and from the emotionally conflicted father ""Takahashi"" (Masahiro Motoki) performances that are mischievous and celebratory at times whilst also touching and quite emotionally charged. The theme also reminds us that many innocent citizens born and as yet unborn were affected by the actions of 1945 than continued to haunt generations long afterwards. I didn't quite love the ending, but this is quite a subtle powerfully story that's worth a watch.",7.0
1311546,Cérémonie d'ouverture des Jeux Olympiques de Paris 2024,"Worst Olympic opening ceremony in history, even worse than Japan's.",1.0
1311546,Cérémonie d'ouverture des Jeux Olympiques de Paris 2024,"The Paris Olympics began on a controversial note, with the opening ceremony drawing criticism for its depiction of the Last Supper, which closely resembled the iconic scene. This choice was deemed inappropriate for an event meant to unite countries and showcase athleticism on a global stage. The incorporation of Greek mythology elements, such as the pale horse symbolizing death, further added to the confusion, especially considering the setting in Paris, France.

The use of cross-dressing performers, specifically drag queens, during the ceremony sparked outrage and raised questions about cultural sensitivity and inclusivity. While promoting peace and acceptance is important, it's essential to consider differing viewpoints and beliefs of nations and religions worldwide. The portrayal of a drag queen with a beard, traditionally representing a woman, led to concerns about the impact on younger audiences and the seriousness of the Olympic event.

Another controversy arose when a competitor tested positive for high levels of testosterone, prompting debates about gender identity and fairness in sports. Whether the individual identified as a trans man or trans woman, the issue of competing in the women's division while possessing male biological characteristics raised ethical concerns. The focus shifted from celebrating athletes' achievements to questioning the integrity of the competition and the organizers' decision-making.

Amidst these controversies, the attention seemed to overlook a competitor with a history of child abuse accusations, competing without facing significant repercussions. The inconsistency in addressing different ethical violations and prioritizing certain controversies over others raised doubts about the Olympics' values and priorities.

The lack of clarity and consistency in handling these sensitive issues left many viewers bewildered and disheartened, leading to disillusionment with the event. The conflicting messages and questionable decisions made it challenging to engage with the Olympics and support the athletes wholeheartedly. Overall, the mishandling of controversies and ethical dilemmas overshadowed the spirit of sportsmanship and unity that the Olympics aim to promote, leaving a sense of disappointment and confusion among spectators.",1.0
831395,Tuesday,"Fables often make for intriguing storytelling and engaging cinematic experiences. And such is the case for the debut feature from writer-director Daina Oniunas-Pusic, a whimsical yet profound tale about the acceptance of death (or, more precisely, the ability to move beyond that and learn how to make friends with death). It’s told through the experience of 15-year-old Tuesday (Lola Petticrew), a terminally ill adolescent whose mother, Zora (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), is struggling to accept the inevitable. Zora looks for excuses to avoid spending time with her daughter, because she’s unable to face the impending truth. But, when death itself suddenly and unexpectedly appears to claim Tuesday, taking the form of a talking, shape-shifting parrot (voiced by Arinzé Kene), Zora’s hand is forced. Somewhat surprisingly, Tuesday reconciles herself to her fate rather easily and subsequently ends up spending most of her remaining time trying to help her mother understand the nature of what’s about to happen – and what will unfold if it doesn’t, consequences with larger implications. In doing so, the film gets into some deeply meaningful material, presenting insights that most of us probably have never considered, let alone explored, shedding an entirely new light on the essence of death, as well as the tremendous burden it has placed on its ornithological messenger. The result is a truly moving story, one that deftly mixes joy and sadness, pathos and humor, and anger and sympathy, not only for mother and daughter, but also for death itself and the wider world of which we’re all a part. The narrative certainly gives viewers much to contemplate, introducing notions that might well raise eyebrows and perhaps even ruffle a few feathers (no pun intended) for those accustomed to more conventional interpretations of this subject. But, in the end, the picture provides a fresh, more mature take on these concepts. Admittedly, the pacing sags a touch in the middle, and the flow of the story may seem somewhat strange or a tad unfocused at times. What’s more, some may question the reasoning behind why death appears as a talking parrot (but, then again, why should it necessarily take some of the more familiar forms we have seen in other stories, such as the grim reaper, for instance?). The film features fine performances, most notably the best screen work Louis-Dreyfus has ever turned in. It also respectfully recalls material presented previously in such perceptively prescient tales as the moving Australian comedy-drama “Baby Teeth” (2019) and the classic Twilight Zone episode “Nothing in the Dark” (1962) featuring a very young Robert Redford. Still, the premise may strike some as odd, absurd or implausible, but, then, when have fables, fairy tales or opera librettos ever faithfully stuck to the tried and true? Suspend your disbelief for this one, and sit back and immerse yourself in what it has to say. You may never look at death the same way ever again.",8.0
666035,Wanted Man,"This reminded me a little of John Wayne's ""Mc Q"" (1974) only this time it's Dolph Lundgren who is the curmudgeonly old cop who bends the rules to suit the investigation. That's caused his bosses a bit of an headache, so they want to put that frankly rather odious ""Johansen"" out to pasture. A trip to Mexico is organised so he can retrieve and escort a vital witness in a double-murder case back to the USA. ""Rosa"" (Christina Villa) is no shrinking violet and the couple don't exactly hit it off, but gradually that all changes as the pair begin to realise that they are being played. By whom, though? That's the six million dollar question. I'm afraid the presence of Kelsey Grammer in anything (except maybe the early editions of ""Cheers"") never bodes well for me, and his mediocrity rather sums up this whole thing. It hasn't an original bone in it's body as it follows well established plot lines, constantly escaping from hellish scenarios against overwhelming odds and firepower. It's as if his dark sunglasses gave him a degree of immortality. Rapid healing powers at any rate. Duplicity, police corruption, betrayal - you name it and it's been squeezed into this bland and repetitive thriller that's very short on thrills. Television fodder at best, sorry.",5.0
1187417,Rumours,"Truly good satire needs a razor-sharp edge to succeed, but this latest effort from director Guy Maddin (in collaboration with filmmaking partners Evan and Galen Johnson) falls stunningly flat, resulting in a rambling, unfocused slog that somehow manages to mix messages and symbology that are simultaneously both cryptically understated and patently obvious. Set at a G7 summit in Germany, world leaders from the host country and their American, Canadian, British, French, Italian and Japanese counterparts (along with delegates from the European Union) hold their annual gathering to discuss the state of the world and pat themselves on the back for a self-congratulatory job well done (despite not possessing the requisite skills to accomplish anything meaningful or of substantive consequence other than keeping their nations’ respective seats warm). They smile their hollow smiles and make empty though allegedly profound observations about a variety of subjects, all while attempting to craft one of their famous joint statements (position papers that the American president openly admits no one ever reads). In this case, the communique is meant to address some kind of undefined global crisis, but it appears to be one with apocalyptic overtones. But, in the course of their “work” – an undertaking for which they’re far from qualified – they quickly find themselves in over their heads when the infrastructure around them begins to crumble, a circumstance made more ominous by the appearance of inexplicable apparitions and zombie-like bog creatures straight out of classic folklore and middle European fairy tales. One might think that this would make for an interesting premise in telling a surrealistically satirical fable about the state of contemporary world politics, but the execution here is so poorly carried off that it ends up amounting to little more than oh so much intellectual and symbolic masturbation (depicted here a little too literally and repetitively at that). To complicate matters, the narrative incorporates countless developments that go wholly unexplained, some of which presumably have to do with the symbolic emasculation of a prevailing patriarchal world in favor of an emerging female-directed paradigm, but others of which are just so enigmatically absurd that they defy description, explanation or purpose (there’s more of that masturbation again, only this time reflected in the nature of the picture’s screenplay elements). The overall result is a mess of a movie that, despite its gifted ensemble cast and atmospheric cinematography and production design, just doesn’t work, especially since the insights it’s trying to impart aren’t particularly new, revelatory or funny. We’re well aware of how inept many of the world’s supposedly astute leaders are these days, including the fact that they’re cluelessly engaged in little more than what amounts to unconscious acts of that aforementioned “self-love” (and self-aggrandizing ones at that), but do we really need a movie to remind us of that (especially one as shabbily made as this)? No thanks. If I were you, I’d duck out of this one and see what else is playing at the multiplex (or, better yet, skip it altogether).",3.0
1187417,Rumours,"When the heads of government from the G7 arrive at a German castle for their annual summit, they expect it to amount to little more than a talking-shop fuelled by fine wine and fine dining before they issue a communiqué that will say precisely nothing of importance to anyone. Things start to look a bit odd, though, when the Canadian ""Maxime"" (Roy Dupuis) can't get a refill for his wine. Where have all the staff gone? No amount of bell ringing is summoning anyone and it's getting dark. Then Frenchman ""Sylvain"" (Denis Ménochet) sets off into the woods in search of his papers that have blown from the table and it's his return, covered in gloop, that really sets their teeth on edge. These are the most powerful folks from the ""free world"" and yet here they are alone and vulnerable - with no mobile phone signal! What now ensues does have quite a potent point to make, but the attempts to deliver that using a combination of soap and comedy just didn't work for me at all. Cate Blanchett is their German host ""Hilda"" (doing her best impersonation of Ursula von der Leyen) and it's clear she has a bit of thing for her Canadian counterpart who also appears to have had some previous assignation with the Brit (Nikki Amuka-Bird) who is close pals with the power-napping US President (Charles Dance) who, in turn, seems to be the idol in the eye of the Italian ""Antonio"" (Rolando Ravello) who seems to be the only one remotely switched on as he had the presence of mind to pinch some salami from the buffet earlier! Maybe the solution to their predicament lies back at the house? Well that's where the thing really comes off the rails as a drama, where a combination of ultra modern day and chronologically ancient contrasting factors try to make sense of this increasingly insensible and laboured  scenario. There is some potency from the last five minutes, in a nihilist sort of fashion, but otherwise the rest of it seems content to satirise something without actually being remotely funny. Dance maybe had the best idea: turn up, eat, drink, nap then wrap himself in tin foil. This is a missed opportunity, sorry.",6.0
933090,Starve Acre,"""Richard"" (Matt Smith), his wife ""Jules"" (Morfydd Clark) and their young son ""Owen"" (Arthur Shaw) have moved back to his late father's remote hill farm. Not long after they arrive the young, asthmatic, lad starts to hear a voice that seems to be compelling him to become erratic, even violent. Before his parents get to the bottom of this, though, there's a tragedy that upends their marriage and sees him spend an increasing amount of time doing what he like to do best - archeology. He is out in all weathers and one day discovers the skeleton of an animal. Meticulously boxing it up, he takes into his study to examine it further. Boy is he in for a surprise and what now ensues takes us all back into his unhappy childhood with a brutish and unloving father and lots of standing about in his underpants. It's starting to look like the folklore surrounding an ancient oak tree that might have been an entrance to the underworld and maybe even the legendary ""Dandelion Jack"" might be influencing their behaviour as their lives take a turn for the distinctly bizarre. It does fall into place a little at the end, but for the most part this all centres around a jigsaw puzzle of a story with too many bits missing. Even if you do know a little about the underpinning mythology, the narrative still has too many gaps. It might make for a solid enough short film but extending this to ninety minutes puts too much pressure on the underwhelming Smith (and his hair) and the presence of her sister ""Harrie"" (Erin Richards) for much of their process of grief just doesn't help to create an atmosphere of menace, pity nor, really, of mystery either. There are a couple of wonderfully ""Arcati"" style performances from local medium ""Mrs. Forde"" (Melanie Kilburn) but the rest of the drama relies too heavily on it's bleak weather and heavily over-scoring. It's watchable enough, but it reminded me a little of ""Enys Men"" (2022) - a quirky story that provided us with some bones of the bones of an intriguing story but where near enough meat to sustain much interest.",6.0

933090,Starve Acre,"Starve Acre weaves together a familiar yet haunting British folk-horror narrative. In it, a man confronts dark, long-buried family secrets amidst the eerie, windswept expanse of the North Yorkshire Moors. The film’s remote setting adds an unsettling layer to the story, amplifying the isolation and creeping dread that define the genre.

Morfydd Clark, known for her captivating performance in Saint Maud, once again brings quiet intensity to the screen. As a mother consumed by the devastation of grief, her portrayal is imbued with a nuanced vulnerability. Clark masterfully conveys a deep, simmering sorrow, holding the audience’s gaze as her character teeters between despair and unravelling. Even as the film spirals into a more fantastical—and arguably more chaotic—final act, Clark remains the emotional anchor, giving the film an emotional weight that lingers.

On the other hand, Matt Smith takes a bolder approach, with an attempted Yorkshire accent that sometimes distracts from the atmosphere rather than enhances it. His brooding presence, marked by moments of intensity and introspection, is overemphasised by a camera that too often lingers in tight close-ups, almost intruding on the subtlety his performance has conveyed.

The film’s eclectic and experimental soundtrack serves as a pulsating undercurrent, heightening tension and disorienting the viewer in all the right moments. It imbues the film with a surreal, dreamlike quality that compliments the folk-horror elements. However, this atmosphere is undermined by introducing a questionable if not laughable animatronic/CGI creature, which feels artificial despite its intended menace and diminishes the immersive experience. What could have been a powerful visual metaphor instead borders on the uncanny, pulling viewers out of the otherwise grounded horror.

In the end, Starve Acre offers genuine emotional depth and atmospheric tension moments. Still, it falters when it veers too sharply into surrealism without the visual craftsmanship to back it up.",7.0

992940,The Critic,"If you saw Sir Ian McKellen with fellow thesp Sir Derek Jacobi in the television sitcom ""Vicious"" from around ten years ago, you'll be able to anticipate the gist of his characterisation of the acerbic theatre critic ""Erskine"" who is way more famed for distributing bile rather than bouquets. His new boss (Mark Strong) wants the newspaper to appeal to an altogether more wholesome family audience and so wants him to tone things down a bit. ""Yeah, right"" thinks he - and then his own behaviour gets him into trouble with the police and given one month's notice from his job. Facing looming ignominy, he determines to get the lowdown on his ostensibly pure as the driven snow aristocratic proprietor and to that end recruits aspiring actress ""Nina"" (Gemma Arterton) of whom he has been much less than flattering in the past. Rather gullibly, she agrees to become a pawn in his manipulate game that leads to a series of misadventures and thence to a tragedy that maybe puts the role of opinionated curmudgeon into perspective. This starts of quite entertainingly with plenty of pith and ghastliness from the star, but very quickly it descends into an entirely far-fetched and rather disappointing affair (no pun intended) that plays to just about every stereotype as it rather sadly sets out to prove that the best bits are all in the trailers. At it's best, the writing does make you smile and writhe a little uncomfortably in your cinema seat, but for the most part it's just predicable with characters that it's fairly easy not to like - except, maybe, Alfred Enoch's factotum ""Tom"" whom at least starts off with some shred of human decency to counter ""Erskine"" and his selfishness. Ben Barnes shows he is ageing well but again hasn't really enough of a part to work with developing his lovestruck character and Strong is really anything but. It does look good, but it's too reliant on a shock factor that isn't so very original and that soon peters out.",6.0
1113583,"Oh, Canada","It’s bad enough when a film disappoints and doesn’t live up to expectations. But what’s perhaps worse is when a picture not only fails to live up to expectations, but also validates the negative reputation that precedes it. Such is the case, regrettably, with the latest feature from filmmaker Paul Schrader, an embarrassingly bad production from an artist who has written and/or directed such masterful works as “First Reformed” (2017), “American Gigolo” (1980), “Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters” (1985), “The Last Temptation of Christ” (1988) and “Taxi Driver” (1976). This miserably unfocused slog struggles to tell the story of Leonard Fife (Richard Gere), a famous but terminally ill director who’s being interviewed for a made-for-TV biography discussing his legendary life and career as a revered documentary filmmaker. However, the protagonist doesn’t see this so much as a congratulatory tribute to his accomplishments but as a cathartic, unburdening confession about the life he led that virtually no one knows anything about. To complicate matters, his rapidly failing health and cloudy memory keep him from fulfilling this objective, especially when he reveals secrets about himself not known by even those closest to him (most notably, his wife, Emma (Uma Thurman), and his protégé, Malcolm (Michael Imperioli), director of the biography), revelations that they’re quick to attribute to faulty recall. Leonard’s previously hidden back story comes to life through a series of clumsy, disjointed flashbacks featuring his younger self (Jacob Elordi) presented in a largely unintelligible fashion that brings new meaning to the term “nonlinear.” What’s worse, though, is that the relevance of these admissions largely goes unexplained and unresolved, bearing seemingly little relation to the nature of his character or his career as an auteur. His flight to Canada and experience as a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, for example, receives surprisingly little attention given that his defection from the US is essentially responsible for what made his vocation as a filmmaker possible. Then there are snippets from his many passing dalliances with women that make for a story more like “Oh! Calcutta!” than “Oh, Canada.” Taken together, these elements make for a hodgepodge of moments from a life undefined, one that viewers are likely to care little about in the end. Such work is highly uncharacteristic for an artist like Schrader, which makes the impression it leaves all the more worse. Whatever the director was going for here, it’s not particularly clear. And that’s too bad, given that the filmmaker appears to have had plenty of good material and resources to work with here, including a cast of players who turn in some of their best-ever on-screen performances, the dreadful script that they’ve been handed notwithstanding. For what it’s worth, the result is a major disappointment, one that exceeds the negative impressions it has already left on so many movie lovers who expect more from a talent like this.",3.0
1042650,Widow Clicquot,"Combining all of the elements that go into making a fine film and blending the various ingredients in just the right proportions is akin to the practice of crafting a fine wine – and quite an irony here given the subject matter of this engaging cinematic biography of Barbe Nicole Ponsardin Clicquot (1777-1866) (Haley Bennett), the French winemaker who became better known as “the Grand Dame of Champagne.” Having inherited the business of her husband, François (Tom Sturridge), after this death, she vowed to continue operating the winery, carrying on his vision for innovation in the face of stiff competition from the rival Moet organization. But doing so was quite the challenge in light of financial difficulties, vintage failures, the questionable business practices of competitors, the responsibility of raising a young daughter (Cecily Cleeve) as a single mother, onerous operating conditions during the Napoleonic Era and the profound doubts of others (most notably her skeptical sexist father-in-law, Philippe (Ben Miles)) about whether a woman could successfully run an organization like this. Director Thomas Napper’s latest chronicles the Widow Clicquot’s inventive efforts to address these issues, as well as her ambitious initiatives to live up to the dreams of her late husband, in large part with the assistance of her loyal distributor, Louis (Sam Riley). In telling this story, the filmmaker seamlessly blends challenging events of everyday operations with flashbacks of a more personal nature, exploring the heartfelt feelings that provided the basis for the Clicquot philosophy of winemaking. The picture’s superbly crafted narrative and screenplay, combined with exquisite period piece production values and excellent performances (particularly Bennett in one of her best on-screen portrayals), make for an involving, multifaceted watch.  Admittedly, there are times in the second half where the story meanders somewhat, and some may find that this release gets a little too detailed when discussing the technical particulars of vinification. However, much of this offering is evenly balanced, effectively holding viewer interest about a subject that’s not especially common in the annals of filmmaking. What’s more, though, on a more philosophical level, this release celebrates the inherent joy and passion involved in the act of creating, ideas applicable to the manifestation of any artform, be it wine or painting or whatever else we’re capable of envisioning and bringing into being. And, if that’s not worth drinking a toast to, I don’t know what is.",7.0
1042650,Widow Clicquot,"Haley Bennett turns in a reasonable effort here as the eponymous lady who has to keep control of her late husband's vineyards at a time in history when Napoleon's wars were raging throughout Europe - and France wasn't doing so well, by this point - and his laws prohibited women from managing so much as a dinner party. The death of François (Tom Sturridge) has left her a property that her former father-in-law Philippe (Ben Miles) is keen to sell to the neighbouring Mr. Moet but with a bit of help from accountant ""Edouard"" (Anson Boon) and roguish distributor ""Droite"" (Paul Rhys) she is determined to develop her own brand of Champagne and, probably more precariously, get the stuff to the well-heeled markets readily prepared to pay through the nose for wine without the ""frog-eyed bubbles"". The framework is here for a good story, depicting the struggles of a woman - and a father - coming to terms with an untimely death amidst a wartime environment. We do learn a little, via flashback, that her marriage was loving but that her husband became mentally ill putting huge stress on this woman and on their young daughter but the dramatisation is rather let down by a typically uninspiring performance from Sturridge and some quite weak storytelling. Certainly, the film looks great and it illustrates well the difficulties in getting the vintage grown in the first place before bottling these mobile explosive devices and taking them, by wagon, to market and it's quite richly scored by Bryce Dessner, but director Thomas Napper has over-relied on the aesthetics of the film and put too little into the characterisations of a woman who clearly knew her own mind and was not going to let her beloved husband's legacy disappear - even at the risk of bankruptcy. It's worth a watch, but a cinema screening doesn't really add much value to this undercooked period drama that just lacked, well, fizz.",6.0

929831,L'Empire,"When a film seeks to tackle such distinctive comedic forms as parody, satire or slapstick, the creators first need to make sure that what they’re hatching truly works. But, in the case of this latest offering from storied auteur Bruno Dumont, the mark is missed by a wide margin. This alleged take-off on classic space operas like the original “Star Wars” trilogy or “Spaceballs” (1987) simply doesn’t cut it, primarily because it just isn’t funny. Perhaps that’s due to the fact that the filmmaker doesn’t seem to be clear on the direction he wants the story to take or the tone with which it’s presented. In a nutshell, two alien species – the Ones (champions of good) and Zeroes (disciples of evil) – have been exiled to Earth (why and by whom is never made clear), where they’re battling one another to win over the control of humanity through their ground zero strongholds in a small French coastal fishing village. But, in telling this tale, Dumont’s paper-thin narrative meanders aimlessly, blending a bland mixture of lame humor (most of which falls positively flat), bombastic but innately shallow soliloquies on the nature of good and evil, unexplained Monty Python-esque absurdist imagery, and gratuitous sexual encounters that appear to be thrown in for little more than titillating filler. To its credit, the picture effectively employs some truly impressive special effects, an eclectic background score based largely on reworked neo-classical arrangements of the compositions of J.S. Bach and Henry Purcell, and a production design that incorporates set designs drawn from Gothic and Renaissance European architecture. It also features a wealth of stunningly gorgeous cinematography, although a number of overlong shots (particularly many inexplicably filmed from too great a distance) could benefit from judicious pruning. So what exactly is the director going for here? Damned if I know. If it’s satire, its symbology is seriously undercooked. If it’s a campy romp, it’s too understated. If it’s screwball comedy, the pacing is too sluggish. And if it’s insightful social commentary, it’s too superficial and doesn’t take itself seriously enough. In essence, “The Empire” may offer some segments that are nice to look at, but that’s about all, considering that the bulk of this release, in the end, really has nothing interesting, meaningful or piquant to say.",4.0
798612,Shirley,"Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm (Regina King), the first African-American woman elected to the House of Representatives, was an inspiring, trailblazing politician, particularly in the areas of race and gender politics. After winning her seat in Congress in 1968, she later went on to run for the Democratic Party nomination for President in 1972. And that impressive background, one would think, should provide the basis for an engaging, uplifting film biography. Unfortunately, writer-director John Ridley’s take on this groundbreaking, often-unappreciated pioneer misses the mark in a number of ways. The biggest problem is a script that tries to cover too much ground in its 1:58:00 runtime, addressing an array of elements from Chisholm’s personal and political life and not covering either area particularly well, most notably in the film’s first half before settling down in the picture’s back end. The narrative jumps around so much that the picture becomes choppy and unfocused – almost incoherent at times – primarily due to some inexplicably mystifying film editing and a lack of sufficient explanation and back story, especially for those who may not know much about the protagonist’s life going in. The film also features some rather questionable casting choices, such as the selection of actor W. Earl Brown to portray Alabama Governor George Wallace, who neither looks nor sounds anything like the conservative Southern Democrat who also ran for President in 1972 and was subsequently shot during the campaign. Even King’s performance is somewhat uncharacteristically lacking as she struggles mightily to definitively capture Chisholm’s singular demeanor and vocal inflections, qualities that sometimes don’t always resonate, despite the actress’s strong physical resemblance to her character. The real standout here is Lance Reddick, who gives one of his career’s best portrayals (as Chisholm’s political mentor) in one of his last screen performances. It’s disappointing that this inspirational social and political leader hasn’t received the worthy cinematic tribute she truly deserves. Perhaps “Shirley” might have worked better as a miniseries than as a standalone vehicle, as that format likely would have provided a better option for more fully telling her story in all of the detail it seeks to depict here. Indeed, for someone who endeavored to rise up to the challenges she faced, it’s disheartening that the film seeking to depict that effort doesn’t match what she so earnestly sought to accomplish.",6.0

1214506,Will & Harper,"Will Ferrell met Andrew Steele whilst both worked on ""Saturday Night Live"". The latter becomes the chief writer on the popular satirical show that started Ferrell on his road to stardom, and the two men became close personal friends. Advance several years and the now 61 years old Steele has written to his friend informing him of his decision to transition into Harper. This fruition of a visceral need to become the woman he always knew he needed to be to be fulfilled and happy has not come without it's trepidations - not least a wariness as to how close friends and his two children are going to deal with this news. Ferrell is nervous as to how to proceed and suggests the best way to really get to grips with this new situation is to take a road trip to some of the places Steele had gone to as a man, and see how the pair deal with these locations now that he is a very deep voiced woman. What now ensues takes quite an interesting look at attitudes across the USA to a ""dude"" who is a woman and though he doesn't exactly face outright hostility (the omnipresent camera crew probably insulates them both from any more reactionary responses of the population) there are some raised eyebrows, sneers and maybe leaving a hidden mic in the room after they'd gone might have provided a more honest appraisal of just what the man/woman in the bar actually did think. Some of those opinions are provided by way of the blunt instrument that is social media as the yellow or, indeed, just stupid, took to their platform of pleasure to let loose their sarcastic and phobic rants that they'd never have had the courage to speak to the woman's face. Of course, the whole thing looks staged and the relationship between the two men can be a little cloying as this over-long documentary takes them on their travels away from the relative safety and tolerances (or indifferences) of the urban metropolises and more into the more traditional and religious communities where ""freakiness"" is a the word of the day.

1214506,Will & Harper,"Friendship is one of those subjects that doesn’t receive nearly enough attention in the movies. Yet, when we look at the many different forms it can take, it certainly provides plenty of fodder for engaging storytelling, given that it’s a topic we can all ultimately relate to. Films that explore particularly fascinating examples of this are among the best, as is the case with the latest documentary release from director Josh Greenbaum, a road trip/“buddy” movie about the friendship between actor Will Ferrell and comedy writer Harper Steele. The longtime friends met years ago when they worked together on Saturday Night Live, but things were somewhat different at that time: Harper was Andrew back then, but he had been quietly harboring feelings about what it would be like to transition to become a woman. After years of hiding this consuming secret, in 2020, Andrew made the decision to step forward and become Harper, a revelation she candidly announced in a heartrending message to Ferrell and other familars. The announcement admittedly came as a surprise to Ferrell, but, given that Steele was his long-tenured compadre, he was naturally supportive. Simultaneously, though, he also wondered, how would a change like this impact the nature of their friendship? They were long accustomed to doing all kinds of “guy things” together, but could that continue with this fundamental shift in their circumstances? That’s what Ferrell wanted to find out, so the duo elected to embark on a 16-day cross-country journey from New York to Los Angeles, with a variety of stops in between. The trip provided an opportunity to see how they could relate to one another under the conditions of this new paradigm, as well as for Harper to see if she could still comfortably enjoy and safely participate in the same kinds of activities she engaged in when she still self-identified as a man. The result is an insightful and touching exploration of finding a new friend in an old companion, examining how things have evolved while at the same time being fundamentally unchanged. Along the way, Will and Harper meet up with family, friends, strangers, transgender activists and former colleagues, such as Tina Fey, Tim Meadows, Kristin Wiig and Lorne Michaels. The picture also delves into the varying attitudes and levels of acceptance transgender individuals encounter in their new lives, some decidedly uplifting and others stressfully agonizing, and not always in line with expectations. “Will & Harper” is thus a heartfelt celebration of friendship with moments that are touching, emotional, funny, silly and revelatory, presenting a wide range of feelings all wrapped up in one affecting package – not unlike what happens in the relationships between all longtime pals. Just because some things change, that doesn’t mean that everything else necessarily has to follow suit, no matter how dramatic the shift may be. But isn’t that what solid friendships are supposed to be all about?",8.0
804406,The Piano Lesson,"When a gifted playwright’s work is adapted for the big screen, the transition from one medium to another can be quite challenging to pull off successfully. And, if the adaptation gets it wrong, it fails to do justice to the source material, an outcome that often unfairly reinforces the blanket denigration often accorded to film as an “inferior” artform compared to others (like literature or the stage). Such is the case, unfortunately, with this latest adaptation of work drawn from the writings of August Wilson, a stage-to-screen cross-over comes up short compared to previous conversions of his material (like “Fences” (2016), which succeeded brilliantly). This tale of two siblings (John David Washington, Danielle Deadwyler) who match wits over the fate of a family heirloom – a piano with a hand-carved façade featuring images of their slave era ancestors – depicts their heated discussions over its ultimate dispensation, one option aimed at selling it and the other bent on retaining it as a treasured piece of family history. As this scenario plays out, however, complications emerge when the ghosts of their deceased relatives and other spirits make their surreal presence known in steering the quarrelsome brother and sister to settle the matter. It’s an intriguing premise, one that speaks volumes about dealing with the ghosts of one’s past, what they endured in their lives and how the impact of their experiences has been passed down to their descendants. But many of the film’s scenes fall prey to one of the key pitfalls that often undermine theatrical adaptations – a series of overlong, stagey, tediously talky conversations that may work on Broadway but that try the patience of viewers on screen. What’s more, many sequences launch into seemingly unrelated exchanges whose connections to the primary narrative often seem tangential at best, segments that are further undermined by loquacious and not particularly interesting dialogues. And, as for the fantasy sequences, their excessively disparate nature is wholly incongruous with the remainder of the film, looking more like they belong in a movie like “Carrie” (1976) than an August Wilson production. While writer-director Malcolm Washington’s debut feature definitely has its strong suits, such as its fine ensemble of performances, inventive cinematography and meticulous period piece production design, it lacks the integral components needed to make this a compelling and engaging watch. To be sure, August Wilson deserves better than what’s materialized here, a film that’s largely forgettable and a pale shadow of his other cinematic adaptations.",5.0
804406,The Piano Lesson,"<em>'The Piano Lesson'</em>, despite peaks and troughs, is largely a good watch. I could feel my interest increase and decrease fairly consistently throughout though, so no doubting more could've been done to keep me more interested - but that I still was, in fairness.

John David Washington and Samuel L. Jackson are two that perform well, but the person that I would rank as the standout is Danielle Deadwyler - great performance! I didn't actually know her 24 hours ago, though I do now after this and <em>'Carry-On'</em>. Michael Potts merits props, too.

It does feature a noteworthy enough story, the music is decent and there are some solid moments in there - the rendition of ""Berta, Berta"" with Jackson & Co. particularly stands out in my memory. I now see that this is based on a play, which is indeed very apparent in a few scenes.",7.0
804406,The Piano Lesson,"This is based on August Wilson's play and you'll never be in any doubt it came from the stage. The style of presentation and the construction of the story is entirely theatrical and that didn't really work so well for me on a big screen. It's all about a piano. ""Boy Wille"" (John David Washington) thinks that by selling it, they could improve their lot. Sister ""Berniece"" (Danielle Deadwyler) thinks over her dead body. That sentiment might actually prove closer to the truth than anyone wants, though, as the story develops and it becomes clear that this beautifully carved piano has no intentions of moving anywhere - and that it comes with quite an haunting provenance. Both characters see this instrument as an integral part of their past - a past peppered with brutality, slavery and hard labour, but can they reconcile any role it has in their future. Samuel L. Jackson features sparingly as family patriarch ""Doaker"" but barely imprints himself on the story (I think it'd have preferred Colman Domingo), Corey Hawkins plays the preacher ""Avery"" as if he were trying to be Eddie Murphy and the rest of it proceeds in a disappointingly soapy style as it mixes all the usual family melodrama with a ghastly, violent history and the tiniest elements from a horror movie towards the end. It does look good, but there's very little pace to the whole thing, there's far too much dialogue for a cinema feature and though the camerawork does sometimes give us an intensity as it mingles amongst the ""Charles"" family, for the most part this is enter stage left, exit stage right sort of stuff that ought to have stayed on it's original medium.",6.0
1143128,Omni Loop,"Possessing profound philosophical, metaphysical and theoretical scientific knowledge can provide us with unique insights into the nature of existence and how reality comes into being, and aspiring to the attainment of that wisdom is undoubtedly a noble and worthwhile goal. But, in all truthfulness, what good is that knowledge if we lack the practical, plainspoken common sense to know what to do with it, particularly when it comes to shaping the destinies of our own lives? Does such a lofty objective truly lead to meaningful satisfaction and genuine fulfillment? Those are the questions faced by fifty-something writer and scientist Zoya Lowe (Mary-Louise Parker) when confronting her impending mortality, an outcome she’s successfully been able to circumvent by employing novel means to avoid it. The catch, however, is that she can only use these enigmatic measures to rewind the clock of her life by a week, a pattern that keeps repeating nearly identically in each case. They may help her stave off death, but do they produce an innately satisfying result? And why can she only go back in time for one week – why not longer and why not past the same end point in each case? After becoming bored with this endlessly repeating scenario, she decides to pursue a different course by launching an investigation into the mechanics of time travel with the aid of an ambitious laboratory assistant (Ayo Edibiri) with whom she has an unexpected chance encounter. However, once their work begins, they come no closer to finding a solution, prompting Zoya to engage in some heavy-duty introspection about such issues as did she make the most of her life up to the start of her final fateful week and what, in fact, constitutes the nature of bona fide corporeal fulfillment? Indeed, she must ask herself, what really matters in life and does her extensive knowledge truly help her understand it? Writer-director Bernardo Britto packs a great deal of genuinely thoughtful material into this intelligently conceived, smartly written, at times poetic story that explores heady sci-fi topics from an intensely personal, extremely intimate standpoint, something rarely seen in films from this genre. It accomplishes this without relying on an abundance of glitzy special effects, instead employing some of the most effective film editing I’ve ever seen, presenting vivid imagery with dazzling, dramatic, rapid-fire precision to captivate audiences and hold viewer attention. It also features what’s arguably Parker’s best on-screen performance, revealing a dynamic range of emotions from joy to sadness to vulnerability not often seen in characters in narratives such as this. There’s a fair amount of well-placed comic relief, too, inspired by the narratives of films like “Groundhog Day” (1993) but without being an obvious copycat. Admittedly, the picture drags a bit at times in the second half (at least by comparison to the sustained frenetic pace of its opening act), but that’s more than made up for by the emotionally affecting closing sequence, one that’s sure to melt viewers’ hearts. “Omni Loop” is unlike most other science fiction offerings that most of us have probably seen, but it’s one well worth a look, especially for the lingering impressions it’s likely to leave on us and the soul searching it’s destined to prompt, considerations we should all bear in mind when it comes to the lives we create for ourselves, undertakings that we should strive to handle skillfully, with a sense of joy and an aim for achieving the greatest degree of fulfillment attainable.",9.0

Weighty themes are tackled head-on, though the film occasionally looks like it's doing the thinking equivalent of spinning plates.

1015634,Sasquatch Sunset,"Movies that provide us with an inside look at the lives of communities different from our own can show us just how much alike – and not alike – the constituencies of those cultures truly are from our own. It’s especially intriguing when such films cross species lines, examining societies of beings different from ourselves, an undertaking tackled in the latest project from the acting-writing-directing duo of David and Nathan Zellner. Known for such offbeat releases as “The Art of Self-Defense” (2019) and “Kumiko, The Treasure Hunter” (2014), this time out the filmmaking siblings present a documentary-style look at a year in the lives of a bigfoot family of four inhabiting the forests of Northern California. The camera follows them through a variety of everyday situations not unlike what we as humans go through, only in a totally different milieu. The film features an array of comedic and dramatic circumstances to which we can all undoubtedly relate, often on a very “earthy,” unrestrained level, involving activities in which we all engage but rarely talk about. Told in four acts, this release beautifully captures their experience of life in the woods, with exquisite visuals of Northwestern landscapes and diverse forest wildlife, along with curious, entirely natural expressions of individuals discovering the myriad elements of a world that they have come to believe is their own. But is it? As they come upon scenarios that are anomalous from what they have typically known, they must learn to adapt when evidence emerges that their world could be drastically changing – even vanishing – before their very eyes. In that sense, then, the film quietly delivers a strong environmental message (aptly timed for an Earth Day release) that we should heed in light of the unsettling experience of this picture’s unique protagonists. While the film’s sequences at times become somewhat repetitive and feature more than their share of undoubtedly base humor, this offering is nevertheless entertaining, clever and thought-provoking, enhanced by its stunning cinematography, emotive original score, and stellar makeup and prosthetics. Despite these assets, however, some have dismissively and capriciously compared this production to an extended Saturday Night Live sketch or a parody of the opening sequence of Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” (1968). But those analogies unfairly sell this one short as a vehicle that will simultaneously make viewers both laugh and think. With an economical 1:28:00 runtime and a fine cast of actors portraying the quartet of uncannily prescient primates (Jesse Eisenberg, Riley Keough, Nathan Zellner, Christophe Zajac-Denek), “Sasquatch Sunset” makes an intriguing watch, provided that viewers give it a fair shake. Indeed, if we’re ever to reach a new level of understanding about those who are different from us and with whom we share this world, not to mention the impact we have on one another, we should make an effort to grasp what this offering is trying to tell us – while we still have the time to do so for both of us.",7.0
1015634,Sasquatch Sunset,"As a fan of the filmmaking brothers David and Nathan Zellner and their offbeat brand of humor and awkward storytelling style, I had much higher hopes for “Sasquatch Sunset” than I guess I should have. Disappointingly unfunny and too reliant on gross-out gags, this weird movie about the antics of a bigfoot family is a massive misfire on every level.

This absurdist film is set up like a bad nature documentary, a strictly observational look at a year in the life of a sasquatch clan. There’s the alpha (Nathan Zellner), the female (Riley Keough), the male (Jesse Eisenberg), and the child (Christophe Zajac-Denek), and their existence is not all that interesting. They forage for food and explore the forest around them, with lots of sniffing, barking, farting, defecating, and scratching along the way. Even a fictional look at the day-to-day routine of a sasquatch brood quickly wears thin.

Perhaps if the Zellners had gone with a more traditional mockumentary route, the movie wouldn’t feel so sluggish. There’s only so much the talented indie cast can do when their dialogue amounts to nothing more than a series of barks and grunts. Buried under layers of fur and makeup, the roles demand a lot of physicality, which would’ve worked far better with more slapstick gags.

The script feels like it was written by 14 year old boys who wanted to include every single poop, pee, and sex joke they could dream up. It also isn’t a good sign that the majority of the time I was questioning whether or not something was supposed to be funny, as it was all so unclear. I do know one thing that was crystal, however: I never laughed. I found nothing to be humorous, just weird and gross (and for the Zellners, that’s saying something).

The interesting thing about all of this is that while the movie isn’t compelling, I was still invested in the outcome. I wanted to know what happened to each of the creatures, even if their eventual fate is a bit of a letdown. The film teeters on the verge of being a total train wreck, yet I couldn’t seem to tear myself away. It’s not bad enough to walk out of, but it’s also not good enough nor enjoyable enough to recommend, which leaves “Sasquatch Sunset” in niche film purgatory. It begs the question, “who is the audience for this?“

1139713,The Radleys,"This could have been quite good. As a black comedy, there was a lot of potential. Unfortunately, as is so often the case with the Western media, this film has had the life sucked out of it by ""the message"". 

All flavours of ""the message"" are front and centre, humorlessly silencing, any potential for genuine black humour. Its a true shame too, because the book this is based upon, is pretty decent, as is the cast they have brought together, for this production. 

Regrettably, entertainment comes a distant second to lecturing, leaving only a dry husk in its wake.

995746,Rosalie,"There's something quite unnerving about this film. It all starts when the young ""Rosalie"" (Nadia Tereszkiewicz) is essentially dowered out to bar owner ""Abel"" (Benoît Magimel) so her father can be rid of her and so that her new husband can be rid of his debts. ""Abel"" is actually quite a decent man, recently returned from the wars, but he is ill-equipped for what he discovers on his wedding night. She suffers from the rare condition of hirsutism and he is repulsed by it. Her dowry didn't quite settle his bills with landlord ""Barcelin"" (Benjamin Biolay) and with his future on the line, she decides that it's time to go on the front foot and display her beardedness. Initially sceptical, it appears that the community are less intimidated by her than ""Abel"" had feared, indeed there seems to be an attraction developing between her and ""Barcelin"". The main drawback she faces, though, is an inability to bear children - that which she wishes for most. His solution is that they adopt, and this is when true colours are displayed and the story takes a slightly more predicable turn - especially as she begins to fall prey to the exploiters who see her as little better than a circus act. It's a love story, one of despair and one that illustrates not just power of superstition but also the continuing role of women in a society that saw them as goods to barter. It looks authentic, and though could maybe do with a little tightening up - there are quite a few repetitious scenes that don't really add much, is well delivered by an on-form Tereskiewicz and from the understated but potent Magimel which coupled with an emotive score from classical and Hania Rani sources to augment it too, makes for an interesting drama that is well worth a watch.",7.0
765421,გადასვლა,"There's something entirely plausible about the performance from Mzia Arabuli in this poignant drama. She is the retired school teacher ""Lia"" who is determined to track down her niece now that her sister has recently died. She lives in Georgia, likes a drink or two, and thinks that ""Tekla"" has fled to neighbouring Turkey where she is able to live her life more freely. She is trans - and that's not a situation encouraged at home! ""Lia"" hasn't a word of Turkish, though, so she agrees to take local wide boy ""Achi"" (Lucas Kankava) with her as a sort of guide-cum-translator. The seedier side of Istanbul beckons for both of them, but what chance of tracking down one person in a city of millions? Fortunately, the young man can't sleep one night and goes out to explore. He makes some new friends and these friends lead them to newly qualified lawyer ""Evrim"" (Deniz Dumanli) who promises to try to help... Now it would have been very easy for auteur Levan Akin to do this the A+B=C way, but he doesn't. He doesn't make the film about the search for ""Tekla"" so much as about a search by this woman to find herself, to reignite her sense of purpose and to to put into perspective issues that drive families apart leaving everyone bereft of affection and understanding. It's that role that Arabuli plays with an honesty that really works. There's an almost maternal chemistry between her and the young ""Achi"" and as they search, we see a city that really is a potpourri of just about every aspect of humanity - some friendly, so less so. I found this to be quite an effective film about live-and-let-live in a city where poverty and wealth exist side by side and where there appears to be a largely prevailing degree of tolerance and, to an extent, generosity of spirit. It's hopeful but not unrealistic, and proof that there's plenty of life in the old girl yet!",7.0

962074,கேப்டன் மில்லர்,"**Captain Miller is Dhanush's most rugged and raw film cinematically with promising conflicts and spectacular staging from Arun Matheswaran**

My Score : 78/100

Captain Miller is undoubtedly the most jagged and gritty staging of Dhanush in a long time. Arun Matheswaran rightfully integrates dacoity, fight for independence and well staged conflicts within the film. He has added brutal gunfights and action choreography is well done throughout while keeping the core emotions elevated at rightful intervals. The presentation of Britishers is pretty stereotypical and repetitive but we can't complain. The music by GV Prakash Kumar is gripping and the background score is efficiently edited into the screenplay. Captain Miller song and its timing is a piece of mass we crave for. The film's runtime is a bit long at 160mins which could have been crisply edited to make more impact. However the cameos are the highlight which sets us up for a rewarding climax.

Dhanush is presented as a resilient ruffian against the Britishers who has done his job brilliantly. He has presented all his emotions be it rage , agony, fear and his insecurities with such conviction that he still stays in my list of most hard-work actors of this generation. He is spectacular in the action scenes and equally magical in his vulnerable scenes. Shivrajkumar even though present for short screentime is given the magical staging he deserves. Sundeep Kishan underutilized but solid while he is on screen. Priyanka Arul Mohan gives an promising performance with scope for improvement. John Kokken seriously needs acting lessons as he was very distracting and annoying.  

Overall, Captain Miller is a promising start for Arun Matheswaran antiques in mass movies. His excellence lies in how well he establishes conflicts and stages raw violence in his films without going overboard. Dhanush's 3 year long sweat is undoubtedly worthy of a watch as this is just the beginning of a devil that Britishers haven't fathomed. The best is yet to come. Kudos to rooted and grounded cinema by Arun which deserves applause.

999582,Babes,"How disappointing it is when you see a movie that you were looking forward to only to walk away unimpressed, if not largely disappointed. So it is with director Pamela Adlon’s debut feature, a comedy-drama about the wild and crazy relationship between two lifelong thirtysomething New York BFFs (Ilana Glazer, Michelle Buteau) who share the experiences of pregnancy, childbirth and parenthood while struggling to maintain the kind of free-spirited friendship they had before becoming mothers. The narrative consists of a series of vignettes – some outrageous, some touching, some serious – involving various aspects of their connection, their individual lives and their interactions with others. Unfortunately, these episodes are wildly inconsistent, regardless of their nature. Some work well (especially, surprisingly enough, those that get unapologetically down and dirty with unbridled raunchy humor), but most others fall stunningly flat for a variety of reasons. The biggest problem here is the writing, which frequently tries far too hard to make the material work. Some segments simply aren’t funny, relying on excessive exhausting mugging and overacting to win over audience members and unsuccessfully persuade them otherwise. Others are utterly preposterous and implausible (despite trying to come across as “zany” or “outrageous”), lacking credibility in terms of plot devices, character development and story flow. And others still are just plain inauthentic, particularly when driven by the strained chemistry between the two often-immature leads, whose supposed bond simply isn’t convincing. What’s more, when the film unsuccessfully tries to turn serious, scenes that are supposed to move and touch viewers don’t work, because the film doesn’t do enough to engender sufficient interest in the protagonists, their challenges or their relationship with one another. To its credit, the film features some fine performances by supporting cast members (John Carroll Lynch, Stephan James, Elena Ouspenskaia), but the leads grow progressively tiresome, especially the longer the movie drones on. In short, “Babes” is a big misfire that fails to deliver despite a few modest laughs along the way. Best bet for this one? Wait for it to come to streaming.",5.0
999582,Babes,"The about to give birth ""Dawn"" (Michelle Buteau) is married to the perfectly manscaped ""Marty"" (Hasan Minhaj) and is best friends with ""Eden"" (Ilana Glazer) who is keen on having a baby but so far lacks a suitable sperm donor. That all changes, though, when she encounters the charming ""Claude"" (Stephan James) on the train and, thinking her period is sure fire protection against getting pregnant, they have some fun. She is smitten, but he disappears without a trace and she just chalks it up to experience. A few months later, though, she gets quite a shock and what now ensues sees the friendship she has with ""Dawn"" quite seriously tested, yada yada. There's nothing new to this at all, and after the first twenty minutes of serious over-acting and a scene where a waiter concerned that the amniotic fluid leaking over the floor of his restaurant might not be that hygienic - and it designated a ""woman hater"", the stall was set out for this frankly quite puerile attempt at comedy. It's structured just as if it's a couple episodes of a mediocre sitcom interspersed by a stand-up routine style narrative from writer Glazer that rehashes a tired girl-power mentality that stopped being funny thirty years ago. I didn't care if their friendship worked or didn't: there's no effort to develop the characters and frankly I'm not surprised ""Claude"" took an early bath from these proceedings. I'm not really a fan of these buddy-comedies that take a relationship that supposedly works, break it, then try to put ""Humpty"" together again for the sake of an ending we could all see from space, and this is another off a conveyor belt completely devoid of originality.",6.0
999582,Babes,"I wish Hollywood would give us more movies like “Babes,” a female-driven comedy that doesn’t hold back. Directed by Pamela Adlon and co-written by Ilana Glazer and Josh Rabinowitz, this outrageous look at pregnancy, motherhood, and female friendship is absolutely hilarious. The humor here is raw, crass, and completely unapologetic, which makes it hard not to laugh at the absurdity of it all, even when the subject matter gets pretty uncomfortable.

Childhood best friends Eden (Glazer) and Dawn (Michelle Buteau) are navigating very different stages in life. Eden is single and really wants to have a baby, and she decides to go it alone after a one-night stand leaves her pregnant. Meanwhile, Dawn is juggling motherhood, work, and the exhaustion that comes with it. Their bond is tested when Eden’s decision to pursue pregnancy on her own shakes up their friendship in unexpected ways.

This isn’t a film where you have to be a parent to “get” the humor, as it’s surprisingly universal. The dialogue is loaded with crude jokes and one-liners, from the constant use of swear words to the endless references to bodily functions. It’s raw, it’s real, and it’s definitely not for the faint of heart. But through all the vulgarity and awkward moments, the heart of the movie lies in the beautiful mess of this tried and true friendship, one that’s as flawed as it is powerful. Eden and Dawn have a bond that’s full of love, support, and a lot of really questionable decisions (like doing mushrooms to solve pregnancy problems).

What really stands out is how the film explores the complexities of camaraderie and motherhood with a surprising amount of tenderness. These two women are deeply supportive of each other, even when things get chaotic. Dawn’s role as a mom is exhausting but relatable, and Eden’s decision to embrace single motherhood on her own terms is refreshing and inspiring, even if it’s a bit over-the-top at times.

There’s a solid message about how family isn’t just about your shared DNA, but more about the people who stick with you through thick and thin. An offbeat comedy with a huge heart, “Babes” is about accepting flaws and embracing the messiness of life.

1025596,Blood for Dust,"“Blood for Dust” is the type of generic crime thriller that not only has a forgettable title, but is something that you won’t remember watching a week later. That doesn’t mean it’s a stinker, though, and Rod Blackhurst’s strong direction and commanding performances from the cast make this slow burn indie a familiar, yet still unpredictable, ride.

Traveling salesman Cliff (Scoot McNairy) is drowning in debt and struggling to take care of his family. All he wants is the American Dream, but the only things he seems to be catching are remnants in the rearview mirror. When he has a chance encounter with Ricky (Kit Harington), a colleague from a dark past he’d rather forget, Cliff joins him and American cartel boss John (Josh Lucas) for a dangerous job that promises a big payday.

It’s a simple story of guns, drugs, bloodshed, and despair that’s well told. The basic script (co-written by Blackhurst and David Ebeltoft) is peppered with dialogue that’s sometimes superficial yet somehow, often profound. This is a small story about of the white American male that’s well told, with strong “Hell or High Water” vibes.

The film is hauntingly beautiful, and Blackhurst nails the moody atmosphere. The cold and bleak landscapes of the snow-covered Montana badlands perfectly complement the story, lending a slice of modern Western Americana that’s rough, rugged, and grim.

I enjoyed “Blood for Dust” in spite of its predictability and flaws because the things it sets out to accomplish, it does so well.

Along the way, there's some scoring that's distinctly Morricone, they encounter the menacingly leprechaun-esque ""Arnold"" (Michael Smiley) and his sidekick ""Zo"" (Morgana O'Reilly) and there's plenty of adventure as they seek evidence of this big black cat (and earn the $50,000 reward that proof of it's existence brings). There's a jolly chemistry here between Fisher and Wood, the writing gives her plenty of opportunity for some sardonic wit and there is also an enjoyably mischievous joy emanating from a Wood who's clearly enjoying himself back in a NZ devoid or ""Orcs"".

Underpinned by their profound Christian faith, they have no lack of optimism but they just need the lucky break! It's a biopic of sorts so no jeopardy, just a journey - and one that I found pretty unremarkable. The wooden as a washboard Lucas Black - sporting way, way, too much beard - makes the occasional appearance as their wealthy, song-writing, friend but the rest of the acting is pretty mediocre as the drama takes a rather traditionally daytime and sentimentally charged approach to family drama tinged with religion and luck (good or bad).

The storyline was truly fantastic, portraying the challenges faced by a family going from a life of luxury to near homelessness. They left one country for another, only to be mistreated upon arrival in the United States. It's heartbreaking to think this happens in real life, and knowing it's based on a true story adds a deeper layer of sadness.

The protagonist's health deteriorated as he endured hardships, ultimately reaching a breaking point. Despite their struggles, the family never lost faith. The mother, a strong and resilient character, held them together.

Throughout the film, I was captivated and emotional, shedding tears at every turn of events. It wasn't just my sensitivity; the movie struck a chord deep within, evoking both sorrow for the family's plight and joy as they began to find their footing.

The message of hard work, dedication, faith, and resilience leading to stability resonated strongly. Witnessing the family's struggles and the small miracles that sustained them was emotionally gripping. It's a film that everyone should watch.

The laws that inherently obstruct her need to be identified, addressed and replaced so as not to protect, or be seen to protect, any influential people from heinous crimes of any sort. It also goes on to demonstrate quite effectively just how difficult - if you are to adopt the ""innocent til proven guilty"" approach that underpins so much of the legal system - it is to adequately codify crimes of an intimate nature ensuring that they are to be objectively dealt with. Especially problematic as there are so often no witnesses and/or extensive time lapses between the incident and any attempt at redress. It's also quite potent at illuminating what I feel are the frequently absurd differentiations between the evidence required for a criminal or a civil case. The latter always feels to me that it's more about balance of probability, sometimes even money rather than seeing the rule of law robustly and impartially upheld in the first place. This doesn't provide answers to these complex issues, indeed I suspect there are no straightforward answers - but that anyone has to go through this kind of emotional maelstrom just to get a day in court is something that the public ought to feel disgusted by.",7.0
1126357,Kabut Berduri,"I've not had much to do with Indonesian cinema, so I thought I'd give Borderless Fog, a go. 

This film is a mixed bag. I had a mate who lived in Indonesia for a time and he described it as one of the most dangerous places, he'd ever been. The notion, therefore, of a single woman or even man, for that matter, turning up from the city in rural Indonesia, to track down a serial killer, who chops off people's heads in the jungle, seems far fetched. The key characters credibility, is not helped by the fact that she's dresses like an extra from Miami Vice, whilst wandering through creepy jungle,  unaccompanied, with limited visibility. 

On the upside the characters, even our Miami Vice extra, grow on you over time. They are thankfully, not your usual cardboard cut outs. I liked, too the general vibe of unsettling, often unseen dread, inherent in the jungle setting and the unusual but disturbing nature of the crimes themselves. 

In summary, a reasonable if not exceptional crime thriller from Indonesia. It ends  better than it starts, so you do need to exercise a little patience with this one. Suffice to say, worth a look.",6.0
1084514,Rob Peace,"Jay Will turns in an engaging enough effort here but I found the whole story just a bit lacking in substance. It's based on a true story, adapted by director Chiwetel Ejiofor who plays the father of the eponymous young lad. He's separated from his mother (Mary J. Blige) but seems to be on decent terms with them as he comes for a routine visit in his dilapidated old car. Quickly, a tragedy strikes and dad ""Skeet"" finds himself sent to prison for a double murder. It falls to son Rob to try to find a way to prove his innocence. Skip on a few years and we find this young man, highly adept at mathematics, proving his genius as he manages to get into the Ivy League thanks to some sponsorship from his prep school but again, he is constantly striving to find a way to extricate his dad from jail. It's his skills at chemistry that now serve a different purpose as he and a few colleagues develop a brand new revenue stream that makes him very popular amongst the student body (and mind) whilst raising the cash to fund his dad's appeal. Meantime, with their community gradually falling to wrack and ruin, he also hits on the idea of using some of his cash to kick-start refurbishment works on over 170 homes that have been abandoned or foreclosed upon to revitalise his community - but when the sub-prime crash hits the world it leaves him desperately exposed in more ways than one. When we get to the end of this film, it does make you look back and think a little about how society can contrive to thwart people with even the slightest degree of social ambition - even when is appears to be eminently commercially viable, but the problem here is that there's just way too much missing from the narrative. We skip ahead when we ought to be developing his character his situation. There is virtually nothing from the trial that convicted his father, for example. Peace is clearly a decent man of idealism, reduced to using the tools at his disposal to funds things way more permanent than a flashy car or some bling for his girl (Camilla Cabello) but again the storytelling leaves us to make too many assumptions about who did what back when and about his own, ostensibly victimless, crimes that risk compromising his long sought goals. Interestingly, this isn't a film that takes much of a racial stance. His colour seems not to have been especially relevant as his education progressed but in the end it was maybe just a short story that's undercooked here and skirts over too many of the issues it needed to fulfil it's promise. It's still worth a watch, but the telly will suit it fine.",6.0
1244244,Cloud クラウド,"This starts off a bit like one of those shows that sells the contents of a locker to the highest bidder and let’s the winner make what they can from the contents. “Yoshii” (Masaki Suda) has a bit of an unfulfilling job and lives with his girlfriend “Akiko” (Kotone Furukawa) in a tiny flat where he buys stuff cheap then marks them up and flogs them online. There’s no quality control involved here, he just creatively peddles any old stuff claiming it is what it probably isn’t, relying on anonymity to ensure that he gets away with it. Convinced they can make it big with their very own auction site, he jacks in the work and sets up a lucrative business. With the police becoming suspicious, things start to take a turn for the more menacing and then some of his disgruntled buyers manage to track him down and set about employing some vigilante tactics to, quite literally, exact their vengeful pound of flesh. With only his loyal and adaptable assistant “Miyake” (Omane Okayama) maybe in his corner, things don’t look so hot for our intrepid entrepreneur as his electronic therapy kits make a more malevolent re-appearance in quite a shocking fashion. For a while this is quite a tensely directed drama that illustrates just how unregulated the internet is when it comes to describing and selling things. Is that an indictment of a capitalist society exploiting the unaware or one of a consumer society who expect to pay as little as possible for quality? Maybe both? Unscrupulousness abounds on both sides. However, once we start to enter the revenge phase of the drama, it fades away into a far-fetched version of a video game where the scenarios become increasingly less plausible, interesting and more repetitive. It raises lots of questions about our behaviour towards and dependency on the web, but it doesn’t really know where to go once it has asked them and perhaps it’s that video game analogy that epitomises the ultimate solution auteur Kiyoshi Kurosawa selects as he presents us with a cinematic version of sticking your head in a sand of virtual reality. The acting is neither here nor there and though it’s starts quite innovatively it just fizzes out - as does the whole thing. Pity, it had potential.",6.0
1209217,名探偵コナン 100万ドルの五稜星（みちしるべ）,"Anyone else think the soundtrack to this reminded them of the BBC ""Sherlock"" series with Benedict Cumberbatch? Anyway, this one sees our renowned diminutive detective ""Conan"" brought in to help ""Insp. Nakamori"" investigate the theft of some priceless Samurai swords. Now they are valuable enough, but somehow our sleuth reckons there is much more to it, and when the legendary ""Kaito Kid"" - usually noted for his jewel thievery - is seen at the scene, the game is well and truly afoot. We've got a generous (and duplicitous) millionaire vying with our investigators and the white caped-kid as the clues start to suggest that the swords could form a code that will lead the way to a secret weapon that could spell doom for the whole nation. Can our intrepid team thwart this evil intent in time? I like these animated stories. Though this one is a little on the long side, and there's a rather annoying romance cluttering things up from time to time, there are plenty of characters to suspect, we are given an inclusive idiots guide to crime-fighting and are led down plenty of blind alleys and shown loads of red herrings whilst the animators deliver some fast-moving sword fights, flying acrobatics and airborne escapades the length and breadth of Japan. I found the ending to be a bit weak, but I like the idea of us all using our little grey cells to sort out a problem that marries crime with history, mystery and myth.",7.0
1058617,Fancy Dance,"It’s frustrating to watch a movie that gets most everything right but ends up going off the rails when it really counts. Such is the case with writer-director Erica Tremblay’s third feature outing about a Native American woman (Lily Gladstone) from Oklahoma’s Seneca-Cayuga Reservation who goes in search of her missing sister (Hauli Gray) at the Grand Nations Powwow in Oklahoma City with her 13-year-old niece (Isabel Deroy-Olson) in tow. But the duo’s road trip odyssey soon turns into a statewide crime-ridden misadventure not unlike the narrative in “Thelma & Louise” (1991). Much of this multilayered tale is actually carried off quite skillfully, spotlighting the challenges that indigenous people (especially women) face and presenting a story with a capably executed, tension-filled, edge-of-your-seat quality, prompting viewers to wonder what’s coming next. However, as the story wears on, it becomes increasingly implausible, culminating in a climax that’s more than a little difficult to believe, its heartfelt sentiments notwithstanding. There are also some intriguing back story elements scattered throughout that, quite frankly, could have been better developed and resolved. That’s indeed a shame, considering how these shortcomings undermine the production’s many strong points. These weaknesses also take away from the outstanding performances of Gladstone (who turns in even better work here than in her Oscar-nominated role in “Killers of the Flower Moon” (2023)) and Deroy-Olson in her big screen debut, as well as an outstanding cast of supporting players. This AppleTV+ original truly has a lot in its favor, but it’s unfortunate that it didn’t carry through on its strengths throughout the entire film. A near hit but one that doesn’t live up to its promise or potential.",6.0
1214508,Sujo,"A revenge killing in a remote Mexican town leaves the already motherless young ""Sujo"" (Kevin Aguilar) an orphan. Luckily for him, his aunt ""Neme"" (Yadira Pérez) rescues him from the same vengeful fate and brings him up determined that he will resist the temptations of the town that might lead him to follow in his father's footsteps. That's no easy task as his close friends soon end up involved with the local cartel and so she sends the now teenage lad to find work in the vastness of their capital. Here he (now Juan Jesús Varela) begins to yearn for an education, and befriends the teacher ""Susan"" (Sandra Lorenzano) but the visit of his childhood friend ""Jai"" (Alexis Varela) reminds him that it's going to be very difficult to cut the ties with his past. This is really quite a touching depiction of a life born into a society that's tight, loyal and violent. Depart from the established order of things and life soon becomes worthless, existence perilous and it's an entire family that can become a target. The young Aguilar sets up the characterisation really quite effectively as an innocent young boy caught up in a maelstrom of events that leaves him rudderless and alone before morphing into the older character whom Varela continues to develop delicately into a young man whose goals, conviction and innate decency might just help him break from the cycle of hopelessness. Pérez also delivers strongly playing on a combination of the practical and the mystical as she strives to keep the lad, and his friends, on a different track - despite the obvious temptations of the bright lights and the money they bring. His late father had a car. A fancy one, at that, and when the young man learns to drive it it might offer him a route out or a route in...? It's a slowly paced affair, this, but essentially it's about choices and brave ones at that. The status quo brings acceptance, brutality and normalcy; a new life requires unsettling changes and risks almost as great. There are no easy wins for this young man.",7.0
1128505,My Dead Friend Zoe,"My Dead Friend Zoe dives deep into the wounds left by war, grief, and unspoken regrets, incorporating a narrative that, while following a familiar structure, never feels emotionally hollow. It's the kind of film where the strength lies not in groundbreaking plot mechanics, but in the sheer honesty of its characters and the delicate care with which their pain is portrayed. Sonequa Martin-Green delivers a magnetic performance - quietly powerful, effortlessly vulnerable, and deeply human. The screenplay leans into genre conventions, but it does so with sincerity, making the emotional beats hit all the harder.

The third act is where everything clicks into place. It's raw, unflinching, and devastating in the most beautiful way - a culmination of internal battles finally reaching catharsis. Director Kyle Hausmann-Stokes doesn't try to overplay his hand, letting the characters carry the weight, allowing moments of silence and memory to speak volumes. Yes, it doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it rolls with such truth and heart that you won't soon forget it. A compelling tale about healing, memory, and the ones we carry with us.

1056746,The Trouble with Jessica,"A dinner party from hell or what? We quickly learn that hosts ""Sarah"" (Shirley Henderson) and husband ""Tom"" (Alan Tudyk) are having to sell their luxury home else face repossession. For some reason that seemed like a good reason to invite long-term friends ""Richard"" (Rufus Sewell) and wife ""Beth"" (Olivia Williams) round for food. It's the latter who throws a real spanner in the works by inviting the eponymous ""Jessica"" (Indira Varma). Let's just say that the hostess and this guest get on like a house that's already burnt down, and as the vino flows (tiny measures in huge great glasses) things come to an head that leaves the four with quite an headache. What now ensues might well have worked on stage, indeed the entire film has a theatrical style to it, but I found it all just a bit to hysteria-prone, contrived and over-dramatic. None of the actors are on especially good form, especially the lacklustre Tudyk and the script seems more determined to make sure each character gets their moment in the spotlight rather than designed to offer us something to laugh - or even smile at. On that front, there are the odd lines to make you titter, but just not enough of them to pass this feature-length more miss than hit sit-com. It will pass ninety minutes easily enough at Christmas on the telly, but nothing much more than that, sorry.",6.0
1239511,లక్కీ భాస్కర్‌,"Lucky Baskhar is an engaging film that blends elements of a middle-class revenge saga with the backdrop of the 90s stock market scandal. Dulquer Salmaan shines as Baskhar, a relatable underdog navigating the chaos of financial deceit while reflecting on the struggles of everyday life. The film cleverly balances charm and drama, making complex themes accessible without losing entertainment value.

From my own experience, I found the film both enjoyable and thought-provoking, particularly appreciating how it captures the essence of resilience in the face of systemic challenges. The direction by Venky Atluri successfully combines humor with serious undertones, reminiscent of The Wolf of Wall Street, yet distinctly rooted in Indian culture. Overall, it's a compelling watch that resonates with anyone familiar with the trials of middle-class existence.

966238,La Cocina,"If you saw “Boiling Point” (2021) then you’ll get the gist of this drama set in an hectic New York restaurant kitchen. “The Grill” might look peaceful to the customers, but it’s kitchen is a multi-cultural, multi-lingual and attitudinal melting pot of cooks, waitresses and cleaners under the guidance of a no-nonsense chef (Lee Sellars) and a slimy manager “Luis” (Eduardo Olmos). It’s this latter man who finds there’s a problem one morning when his boss reports that $800-odd is missing from one of the cash registers and the owner “Rashid” (Oded Fehr) is seeing red. Using the investigation as a pretext, we quickly discover that this room is full of characters who generally rub along ok with each other, except for “Pedro” (Raul Briones) and “Max” (Spenser Granese), with the latter man frequently and violently fed up with the lack of English being spoken in this kitchen of Babel. Meantime, “Pedro” is trying to rekindle his relationship with waitress “Julia” (Rooney Mara) who is expecting, but not intending to have, his baby. With everyone working flat out, the search for the missing cash and the prevailing, accumulating, sense of toxicity amidst this atmosphere, the scene is set for quite a lively look at the trade, it’s traditions and the vulnerability of so many workers with a dubious legal status who are treated little better than slaves. Sadly, though, for me the film just didn’t take off. Aside from the fact that there is simply far too much dialogue, it is much too long and the characterisations are way too shallow and under-developed. The acting isn’t especially engaging, and the writing doesn’t do enough to create anyone here that is liable enough to feel the remotest sympathy for. There are too many repetitious angry confrontations without enough humour to entertain or sustain much interest and as they quite literally wade through the story, it just runs out of steam before bordering on the farcical at the end. It’s disappointing, sorry.",6.0
1233208,संतोष,"Recently widowed and facing the loss of her home, the eponymous woman (Shahana Goswami) is offered a chance to take over her late husband's job as a police officer. Having basically inherited his post without any training, her first task is to work with the no-nonsense ""Insp. Sharma"" (Sunita Rajwar) on an horrific case in which a young girl has been brutally raped and unceremoniously dumped in a fairly lawless area of Northern India. Disgusted by the crime and by the societal attitudes of many of those the investigations touches - who mostly couldn't care less - we alight on a candidate for the crime and what ensues tests not just her mettle as a police officer but her own morals as the methods of interrogation employed by her new boss are not exactly court-ordered. That's the potent thrust of this film for me, and I didn't find that to sit so easily. The atrocity of the crime is symptomatic of cultural attitudes amidst a society where women are little better than chattels to be used and disposed of by men as required. The question of ethics starts to loom large, though, when the suspect is treated with a brutality that asks whether two wrongs make a right. It's a sort of vigilante justice that pays scant, if any, regard for due process and begs huge questions which are addressed quite poignantly at the very denouement of this quite harrowing and thought-provoking drama. The acting itself is all adequate enough but I thought Goswani relied too much on long pauses and silences to convey the sense of conflict faced by her character as the plot developed. She's not helped by the staccato writing that can hit some potent notes at times, but for the most part seems content to let what we are seeing do the work - and that left me feeling a little uneasy about the retributive elements of the drama. There's no doubt that it does provoke a conversation about women's rights in India and about their appalling position within a male-dominated hierarchy, but is throwing the rule of law under the police bus the answer?",6.0
1226141,破·地獄,"""Dominic"" (Dayo Wong) is struggling to make ends meet, post COVID, with his business in tatters and his repayment bills at almost $13,000 per month. He's not afraid of hard work, though, so when his ""Uncle Ming"" (Paul Chun) offers him his share in a funeral parlour he jumps at the chance. His partner - rather sarcastically referred to as ""Hello Man"" (Michael Hui) comes across as a rather curmudgeonly fellow - a traditionalist Taoist priest who lives with his ambulance-driving daughter ""Yuet"" (Michelle Wai) and his favourite son ""Ben"" (Pak Hon Chu) who is attempting to follow in his father's footsteps. Thing is, in his excitement to get the job done and to make enough money to clear his debts, he makes quite a few schoolboy errors at the start that are way more lively to offend the ancestors than send them peaceably on their way to the next life, and that just irks the older man who feels his new pal is disrespectful. As the story unfolds, we follow a young man who learns a little more about a business that is really anything but. At times this is quite a funny story, with a special appearance by a full-sized, papier-mâché, yellow Maserati rather summing up the ineptness of ""Dominic"" as he strives for success, but that humour rather quickly evaporates leaving us with a familial drama the can be quite poignant at times as it looks at the restricting roles for women and the hereditary responsibility of sons. Given the professions of the characters, grief is never far away and we focus quiet tenderly at times at just how people come to terms with that - or not, whilst we also try to reconcile just how families themselves change from generation to generation, with some tough decisions having to be made that centre around ""Ben"" and his need to look forward and not back. The acting is engaging and the dialogue well written, allowing the action to do plenty of the work without subjecting us to a constant surfeit of chatter, and it handles the topic of death and the provisions we make to deal with it and it's aftermath sensitively.",7.0

Thing is, his elder brother “Jorge” (Renan Capivara) and he owe the local queenpin “Bambina” (Fabiola Liper) one last favour. “Heraldo” goes out and gets laid in the town’s knocking-shop-cum-motel and awakens to discover that his brother tried to do the job en seul and, well now the young man has to find somewhere to hide. Fortunately, he made a bit of an impression at the motel with it’s owner “Dayana” (Nataly Rocha) and so she agrees to shelter him whilst her brutish and frequently drunk husband “Elias” (Fâbio Assunção) lets him do odd jobs. From here on in, you can probably guess what happens and that’s not without it’s just deserts and irony. There’s some humour to be had, plenty of sex (even the donkey’s get some fun) but as the thriller element starts to kick in the writing starts to become more important and doesn’t really rise to the occasion as it gallops along to it’s conclusion. There is some sexually charged chemistry between Rocha and Xavier but too much of the plot is either implied or just plain missing and in the end, though it’s a good looking and effectively seamy looking production, it disappointingly ran out of steam.",6.0
921436,탈주,"Having seen the trailers for Escape I looked forward to this film but somehow, it didn't quite live up, to my expectations. 

On the upside there is a lot of decent action and characterisations. The two main protagonists, the soldier trying to defect to the South and the North Korean senior officer, pursing him, are well rendered and inherently  interesting. 

That said, Escape fails to bring things together in a wholly satisfying way. It repeatedly builds and dissipates tension over the course of the film, making the experience feel uneven and at times, a little repetitive. 

On a different note there's also a dash of the by now usual woke nonsense, clumsily  designed to highlight the ""intolerance"" of the North Korean regime towards people of differing sexual proclivities. I don't really care but the incessant politicking is tiresome. You could argue too, there's a counter argument for being ""tolerant"" of differing, non-westernized, societal norms but anyway......

1184889,जिगरा,"Directed by Vasan Bala and starring Alia Bhatt, Jigra is an action thriller centered on the bond between a sister and her brother, but it struggles to deliver its emotional and narrative punch. While the premise is intriguing, the execution feels flat. The pacing drags in the first half, and by the time the action kicks in, the momentum is already lost.

Alia Bhatt gives a decent performance, but even her efforts can’t overcome the film’s underwhelming script. Supporting characters like Muthu, the ex-cop, and Bhatia, the reformed gangster, have potential but fall into predictable clichés. The emotional beats, which should have carried the film, feel forced, and while the setting and cinematography are visually appealing, the action sequences lack the intensity needed to truly engage.

Ultimately, Jigra has moments of promise, but it fails to leave a lasting impression. Its exploration of themes like loyalty and justice barely scratches the surface, leaving viewers with a movie that’s watchable but forgettable.

1101256,Dahomey,"With over 7,000 pieces taken by the colonising French from their homes in the ancient African kingdom of Dahomey (now Benin), there is much celebration amongst the population at the return of 26 artefacts. These range from statues of their legendary Kings Ghezo and Béhanzin to objects of religious significance and items of such an intricate design that their condition will require perpetual care in a new, purpose-built, home near the Presidential Palace. Sadly, we just don't spend enough time with these beautifully crafted sculptures, nor do we really learn very much about the history of them, their historical provenance nor really anything much about the colonial ""treaties"" that facilitated their move in the first place. It lacks a narration. Not often that bothers me, but at times this whole thing reminded me of one of those films you'd watch for ten minutes if you were visiting a museum before you moved on. It's presented as if it were the introductory edition of a multi-part documentary that was going to explore more and fill in many of the gaps left unexplained in this hour long preview. Too much of it is spent following a group of young people in a forum arguing about the relative merits (or demerits) of this gesture from the French, and though it can be interesting at times to listen to the differing views in this ""what's past is prologue"" type debate, it wasn't what I wanted to see. I wanted much more about the fascinating mythology that attributed animal features to human beings in the way the Egyptians did two thousand years earlier. What was their significance? How were they to be conserved, preserved, exhibited - and, quite importantly, to whom. None of that was really gone into and I found that all a little disappointing.

1079244,Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin,"Heroes come in many forms, and, regrettably, they often go unrecognized for their efforts, which is why movies honoring them for their accomplishments can be so vitally important, particularly in attempts at correcting the oversight of being overlooked. However, when it comes to writer-director Todd Komarnicki’s cinematic tribute to Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906-1945) (Jonas Dassler), a little-recognized German theologian who was sharply critical of the Nazis’ treatment of Jews and imprisoned dissidents during World War II, that noble goal goes largely unfulfilled. To be perfectly honest, this film is dreadfully dull, relying on a lot of preaching and protracted conversations to carry the narrative, not exactly what I would call engaging and compelling viewing. Indeed, if Bonhoeffer was supposedly so influential in spearheading German resistance against the Third Reich and criticism of Germany’s national church for its silence toward and complicity with Adolf Hitler’s policies, his initiatives, at least as portrayed here, aren’t particularly enlightening or instructive. To make matters worse, the picture’s flashback-oriented approach alternating between Bonhoeffer’s final days and events from his past lends little to telling his story, occasionally causing pivotal developments in his life to become more muddled than enlightening. Perhaps this production’s biggest sin, however, is its alleged tampering with the facts, including events that never took place, others whose content was significantly altered and still more for which there are only vague suggestions about their validity but for which substantial proof is lacking. The result is a release where viewers might easily come away from it not knowing what to believe given its fabrications, alterations and lack of coherence. That’s even apparent in the title, whose qualities attributed to the protagonist could be considered specious, at least when it comes to his supposed role as spy and assassin. To its credit, though, there are moments when Bonhoeffer’s outspoken views are presented through powerfully delivered statements (though the same could also readily be said of the words of some of his peers), but they’re too few and far between for my tastes. In addition, Bonhoeffer’s prolific career as a writer goes largely unnoticed, reducing his 34 volumes of work to little more than a footnote and a few passing references. It’s truly sad to see a film that gets things wrong as badly as this one does, especially when it comes to recognizing the work of someone who is said to have had as much impact as he did. Unfortunately, the oversights here continue.",4.0
1079244,Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin,"Dietrich Bonhoeffer (Jonas Dassler) is a pacifist pastor who is furious at the acquiescence of the German church with the rise of the Naziism and the establishment of the puppet “Reichskirche”. Unlike many, though, he is prepared to use his position in the pulpit and preach to anyone who will listen of the folly of this plan. Needless to say, this doesn’t go down well and so he has to spend a lot of time out of the country whilst many of those left behind fall victim to persecution. That absence has it’s uses, though, as he hopes to galvanise opinion in both the USA and the UK - a task all the harder when his forebodings fall largely on deaf or unwilling ears. It’s when his colleagues come up with a plan to assassinate their Führer that the threads of his multi-timeline story and his life start to come together and we realise just how perilous his position is when he finally returns to his homeland. The is a true story of a man who dared to fight back in the face of overwhelming odds, indifference and fear - but sadly I just found Dassler didn’t, well, dazzle. Even at his most animated, his characterisation was underwhelming and contributory to this looking more like a high-end television movie rather than an enlightening story of courage and, to a certain extent, faith. The ensemble cast do well enough, but again there isn’t really an anchor role to give it the necessary gravitas either within the church, or amongst his allies. Even Churchill is presented as lacklustre. Bonhoeffer was a jazz lover and that does give us an excuse to indulge in the odd bit of toe-tapping, and the whole story is a savage indictment of complicity when the state gets up on it’s hind legs and mobilises the militia and the militant, but this disappointed, sorry.",6.0
971968,Maria,"In an age when rights and protections for women are increasingly being placed in jeopardy, their preservation is imperative, and nowhere is this more apparent perhaps than in writer-director Jessica Palud’s latest feature. In this flashback to a time when things were very different for women, the filmmaker places the spotlight on the sexist, demeaning demands that were placed on actress Maria Schneider (1952-2011) (Anamaria Vartolomei). Schneider’s big career break came at age 19, when she was cast opposite screen legend Marlon Brando (Matt Dillon) in “Last Tango in Paris” (1972), the highly controversial hyper-erotic feature from director Bernardo Bertolucci (Giuseppe Maggio). What should have been a tremendous opportunity for the aspiring actress turned nightmarish when Bertolucci changed the nature of the film’s ending without informing Schneider of what it entailed, a move allegedly aimed at getting as “natural” a performance out of her as possible. Shockingly, that change in plans resulted in one of cinema’s darkest and most disturbing moments, when Schneider was subjected to a degrading act of debasement that affected her deeply, not only as shooting was wrapping up, but also afterward in both her professional and personal life. Her reaction was indeed “natural” in that it evoked severe fear and anguish in her (and among audiences) as it played out, ostensibly depicting an act of rape that appeared so authentically that it was difficult to believe it was merely simulated. In the wake of this outrageous atrocity, many filmgoers scorned Schneider for lascivious on-screen behavior (none of which originated with her), and she was subsequently only offered roles primarily built around the perception she was little more than a sex object, developments that Schneider spoke out about publicly but was quickly silenced by the movers and shakers in the male-dominated movie industry. In turn, these incidents troubled her so profoundly that she sought refuge as a heroin addict, subsequently experiencing financial difficulties and strained relations with her partner, Noor (Céleste Brunnquell), and her staunchly supportive Uncle Michel (Jonathan Couzinié), the only relative who stood by her through these crises. And, even though Schneider managed to steadily find work in mostly smaller roles throughout much of the remainder of her career, she was never the same person she was before the trauma she underwent on set. This offering thus presents viewers with a disturbing cautionary tale not only about what happened to the actress, but also of what women often had to endure at the time, conditions that, sadly, could be making a resurgence as safeguards protecting them against such treatment are being systematically dismantled. Because of that, “Being Maria” makes for a very disturbing watch at times, a picture sure to provoke justified outrage among viewers. In telling Schneider’s story, the filmmaker has crafted an edgy but engaging work that features superb performances by leads Vartolomei and Dillon, as well as by Maggio as the creepy director who spawned these despairing developments. Admittedly, there are times when the pacing here could stand to be a bit brisker, but that’s a small consideration in the face of everything else that this release gets right. To be sure, one might not feel comfortable in watching this biopic, but, then, that’s the point of it – showing the unspeakable indignities that this woman faced and that society should do all it can to prevent from happening again.",8.0
1291594,Beezel,For an indie film that was likely created on a lower budget than most multi-million dollar films this was extremely impressive as it relates to the quality in which it was produced...likely on RED cameras? and holy mackerel the sound design was INCREDIBLE. Yeah the first 45 minutes is the freakiest but the jump scares and suspense throughout the whole film are well worth the watch. I haven't heard of Aaron Fradkin or Victoria before but I will for damn sure be checking out whatever they put out next. I hope someone recognizes the quality in which this was produced and gives them an opportunity to make another film in a similar vein with a bigger budget because the vision that they made come to life spoke volumes to anyone that appreciates the horror genre. Full support here. I hope others give an honest review like mine and appreciate this for what it is -- a truly creative and incredible work of art in a world that is so tough to stand out in.,10.0

1217379,Hellhound,"To be fair Hellhound actually makes an effort to be a little original and thoughtful and ""sort of"" succeeds.

There's a fair amount of decent content, in this admittedly B grade action film. Firstly there's a not wholly original story that still tries to make take a thoughtful moral stance, reasonable acting and well considered exposition. 

What really undermines this effort is a lack of overall cohesion. The story simply feels too loose, which, I think, is due in large part, to budgetary limitations.

That said, as it stands the lead hands in a decent performance and the action is well thought out and fast paced. 

In summary, not a bad effort for a B flick. The thought put into the script pays off to a degree, whilst the fight scenes are well choreographed and convincing. Worth a look.",5.0
610219,The Fire Inside,"Ryan Destiny and Brian Tyree Henry deliver quite strongly in this biopic of the USA’s first boxing Olympic gold medalist. It follows her own career path so we know just what happened where and when, but it’s the characterful efforts that resonate more as she portrays Claressa Shields. From a very young age this tenacious young girl (Kylee D. Allen/Jazmin Headley) is running for miles to reach his gym only to be told that she couldn’t train with the boys. Henry’s Jason Crutchfield does give her a chance eventually and that’s what convinces him that she has potential. Despite her growing up in a poverty-stricken home, with her father incarcerated, they determine that if she can dedicate herself to her chosen path then perhaps fame and fortune might follow - and that proves quite an incentive for a woman who wants, passionately, to get her family out of their squalor. It’s quite an interesting look at the efforts and politics required to attain selection, exacerbated by a general reticence amongst the sporting authorities about women boxing at all and it also illustrates just how fickle those few moments of fame can be when it comes to resonating with the marketing and sponsorship communities who are all too quick to say thanks but no thanks after the ticker-tape parades have ended. Although this is very specifically aimed at her particular achievements, I think it’s fair to apply the principle to a great many would-be Olympic (amateur) athletes who participate in less lucrative sport - regardless of their sex - and who live on meagre pickings whilst others - usually in offices somewhere - reap greater financial rewards. Moreover, even the little cash on offer to assist (in her case a mere $1,000 per month but even for the men with whom she rightfully demands parity, it’s only $3,000) doesn’t extent to their training and support personnel whose relationships, rapport and dynamic with the athlete would seem better placed to deliver results. It’s interspersed with plenty of faux-actuality to give us a sense of just how strenuous this activity is, and as sporting dramas go it delivers fact, fiction and inspiration in a tempered and authentic fashion. Worth a watch.",7.0
881366,The End,"With some sort of global apocalypse having occurred up top, a family have taken refuge deep inside a salt mine where dad’s previous profession in the energy sector has ensured that they live a civilised and well appointed life. With Reubens and Rembrandt augmenting their oak-clad walls, Michael Shannon and Tilda Swinton have brought up their son, George MacKay, with the help of her best friend Bronagh Gallagher, a doctor (Lennie James) and their gay butler (Tim McInnerny). They spend their days rehearsing for disaster scenarios and rearranging their home, whilst the son writes a memoir for his father that marries an (environmental) history of the world with a curiously slanted homage to the efforts made by his father to provide unlimited cheap energy to the masses! Then one day, this Elysian dream becomes compromised by the arrival of a young girl (Moses Ingram) and that puts them into a quandary. Do they let her stay or do they evict her back from whence she came? If she stays, how might she upset the dynamic amongst a family who have clearly only a wafer thin sheen over a multitude of issues from their respective pasts that have largely been forgotten for then twenty-odd years they have lived their subterranean existences? There is singing, and a lot of singing - and with the possible exception of Ingram, none of them are very good at it. That doesn’t matter, though, as the score from Marius de Vries and Josh Schmidt combines just about everything from Rachmaninov and Gershwin to Lloyd-Webber, Rice, Pasek & Pau. Once your ears get used to the sometimes grimace-inducing falsetto of an enthusiastic MacKay and an on-form  but fairly tuneless Swinton then this actually works quite entertainingly. Gallagher can always be relied upon to add a little vitality to a story and McInnerny also knows how to ham things up (just as he did in “Gladiator II”) to good effect, too. The timelines jump now and again, but never by much and it has quite a quirky effect on the delivery as characters appear to, well, disappear, at the end of the scene. MacKay steals this for me, delivering a role that reminded me a little of Luke Treadaway’s Olivier award winning stage effort as “Christopher” from “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time”. His journey to adulthood being tempered by a very slightly autistic characterisation; a dependant relationship with his mother and his own clearly awakening hormonal desires, too. It’s long, and at times can be a bit hit or miss - but generally it does flow along well, in a very theatrically staged fashion and if you are looking to see something that takes just about everyone from their comfort zone, then this might be for you.",7.0
1170824,American Star,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/american-star-review-a-contemplative-introspection/

""American Star is a commendable self-reflection character study, bolstered by Ian McShane's brilliantly contained performance, a thematically rich narrative, and a truly gorgeous location.

The contemplative storytelling contributes to an immersive viewing experience about coming to terms with our doings in life, despite some predictability issues and an unnecessary character that robs the movie of a more fitting, emotionally impactful ending.

It occasionally falters in keeping its momentum, but the crew and cast ultimately succeed in prompting introspection on the moral intricacies of human nature and the inevitability of change.""

1069187,Shoshana,"This is a curiously undercooked iteration of a story that well exemplifies that expression about one man's terrorist being another's freedom fighter. It's the underwhelming Douglas Booth who is Wilkin, a police detective based in British-administered Palestine and a man who has a semblance of decency to him. His boss ""Chambers"" (Ian Hart) is a bit more of a player, though - and he drafts in the much more ""hands-on"" Morton (the unremarkable Harry Melling) to get results more quickly - not least the apprehension of Stern (Aury Alby) who is determined to establish a Jewish homeland and doesn't much care which tactics he uses to accomplish that. The personal story is largely historical fact, so there's no real jeopardy here, but it's an interesting postulation on just how the British tried to administer a region and a population that had no interest in being administered, and that was being logistically manipulated with the shortest of term vision for anyone's future. Palestinian and Jew could agree on just one thing - get the UK out, but thereafter there was little consensus as the bombs and the bullets continued to fly. To be honest, I found the contribution of the eponymous woman (Irina Starshenbaum) to be almost incidental to what is essentially a rather dryly brutal story of a territory that always has been and will be fought over. It looks fine, but somehow it's all just a little too bitty - episodic, even, and it needed a bigger hitter to deliver the narrative more engagingly and convincingly. Pity.",6.0
918287,I Used to Be Funny,"With “I Used to Be Funny,” writer / director Ally Pankiw intertwines mystery and emotional depth to create a compelling narrative in her dark dramedy about a missing teenage girl and her friendship with a stand-up comedian with a debilitating case of PTSD. By exploring the various complexities of trauma, recovery, and healing in a refreshing, honest way, the film is poignant and feels highly personal. This is a story of emotional suffering, fractured relationships, and the long-term process of reclaiming happiness and a sense of identity.

Revealing too much of the plot will spoil the film, so this review will be as vague as possible.

Sam (Rachel Sennott) is an aspiring comedian who works as an au pair for Brooke (Olga Petsa). Told in flashbacks over a span of the last two years, the story begins with a news report that Brooke has gone missing. Sam, who is suffering from a traumatic event, decides to join in the search for the girl she used to nanny. Blending the past and present, it becomes clear why these two women are dealing with emotional wounds in their own unique way.

This is the perfect vehicle for Sennott to showcase her range as an actor, and she delivers a powerful performance. she captures the complexity of her character with nuance, blending drama with a touch of comedy when her situation becomes too much to bear.

While her story isn’t on its own very original, Pankiw is an outstanding storyteller, shifting seamlessly between the past and present. The dual timeline keeps the narrative unpredictable and surprising, which will keep you engaged during the film’s slower moments (it could use some tightening overall). The challenging subject matter can feel upsetting and heartbreaking, but it’s also so important to see stories that highlight essential aspects of the female experience. Sam and Brooke have a loving yet complicated relationship, and Pankiw explores this friendship with a heart-wrenching candor.

“I Used to Be Funny” isn’t a film that’s easy to watch, but it gives a highly realistic portrayal of the slow and agonizing healing process after living through a traumatic experience.

1242526,Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot,"When her aged mother dies, Donna Martin (Nika King) feels like she has lost her best friend and is completely bereft. No consolation from her pastor husband WC (Demetrius Grosse) nor their children can help her with her grief. Then, in an almost Damascene moment, she hears of a young child struggling through the East Texas care system and decides that it's going to be her calling to help where she can. WC needs quite a bit of convincing as their house is already full, their income limited and their time stretched too - but he agrees to investigate with local child support worker Susan Ramsey (Elizabeth Mitchell). Next thing, they are bringing home some orphans and the congregation at their lively community church are likewise encouraged to do what they can to help these kids. In full swing, there are some seventy-odd children housed amidst this loving but quite financially poor community - and that's the gist of the rest of the film. How folks cope. Many of these youngsters, of varying ages, don't have their troubles to seek. Years of neglect and indifference have created demons that test the patience, love and commitment of the well-meaning would-be parents with not just their task at hand, but with their Christian faith. The Martin's are not immune to these challenges either, especially when they take in Terri (Diaana Babnocova) who retreats into the persona of a cat following a childhood of beatings and abuse, and that in turn manages to readily antagonise their own daughter Ladonna (Kaysi J. Bradley). This is quite an empowering story of just what can be done when there is a will to try and despite there being a paucity of resources these people remain determined that they can and will make a difference, even if it means discomfort and stress for themselves. That's all well presented by the supporting ensemble cast who support a strong effort from both King and Babnicova that marries well determination, frustration and raw emotion. It also takes a tangential swipe at the priorities of a church perhaps more concerned with edifices than education which, though briefly exhibited, is still quite a potent indictment of attitudes. It's probably twenty minutes too long, it does meander a little at the start, but as a drama about real people confronting issues that are, quite literally, life and death - it's worth a watch.",7.0

999621,BRATS,"Andrew McCarthy’s latest documentary had the potential to be a nostalgic masterpiece, reminiscent of an era that defined a generation. However, it ultimately fell short, primarily due to McCarthy's involvement. As a fan of the films of the 'Brat Pack', I believe this documentary missed the mark in several key areas.

This documentary, clocking in at ninety minutes, feels like an extended exercise in grievance rather than an insightful exploration of the ""Brat Pack"" phenomenon. McCarthy’s evident resentment toward the term ""Brat Pack"" permeates the film, transforming what could have been a celebratory reflection into a personal vendetta.

Rob Lowe emerges as the standout element of this documentary. His pragmatic and almost philosophical take on the ""Brat Pack"" label illustrates why his career has endured far longer compared to some of his peers. Lowe’s commentary offers a stark contrast to McCarthy’s bitter tone, highlighting a significant thematic divide within the film. For instance, when Lowe discusses embracing the label and moving forward, it provides a refreshing perspective that the documentary sorely lacks overall.

The documentary might have been more engaging if it had included a narrative arc where McCarthy evolves to appreciate the title. Unfortunately, this journey of self-awareness is conspicuously absent. Instead, viewers are left witnessing McCarthy struggle with a term that continues to haunt him. This lack of growth or resolution undermines the film's potential impact. Imagine if the documentary had culminated in McCarthy’s acceptance and understanding of the ""Brat Pack"" label, much like how documentaries such as ""Won't You Be My Neighbor?"" successfully showcase personal and professional transformations.

The final few minutes of the documentary attempt to offer some praise towards the ""Brat Pack"" moniker. However, McCarthy’s apparent discomfort with this positive shift renders it ineffective. It feels like a last-ditch effort to garner sympathy or agreement after realizing that his peers have moved on. The film would have been significantly more compelling if it had focused on this reconciliatory tone throughout, rather than relegating it to the closing moments. Think of documentaries like ""20 Feet from Stardom,"" where the ending brings a sense of closure and triumph, something McCarthy's film could have greatly benefited from.

In conclusion, while there are fleeting moments of introspection and commendation, McCarthy’s documentary ultimately flounders in its bitterness. The best parts of the film are ironically the credits, leaving viewers to wonder what could have been if the entire documentary had embraced a more reflective and less antagonistic approach.

For a documentary that could have celebrated the legacy of the ""Brat Pack"" and provided a cathartic journey for its creator, it instead serves as a reminder of how unresolved resentment can overshadow the opportunity for meaningful storytelling.",3.0
999621,BRATS,"Most Gen Xers will remember with fondness the infamous “Brat Pack,” a group of young stars who ruled the entertainment world back in the mid-1980s. Nobody was bigger than these actors, including Rob Lowe, Ally Sheedy, Demi Moore, Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, and Judd Nelson. But with that superstardom and unfortunate moniker came decades of sadness, regret, and pain.

One of the original members of the Pack, Andrew McCarthy, decided to make a film to deal with the group’s shared experiences after being collectively labeled by an article in New York magazine in 1985. The result is “Brats,” a deeply personal and surprisingly insightful documentary.

This is a terrific film, especially if you’re interested in the subjects. McCarthy has a personal connection that gives him more intimate access to his former co-stars (many of whom he hasn’t seen nor spoken to in over 30 years). Some are more forthcoming than others (the raw honesty and heartfelt interviews resemble difficult therapy sessions, especially with an incredibly open Moore and a standoffish, obviously still-pained Estevez), and a couple of the former Brat Pack refuse to talk to him at all. But what is revealed is fascinating in a way that’s unexpected, and it’s clear almost all of them have been living with a heavy burden from the typecasting that significantly impacted their careers and personal lives.

McCarthy has created a cathartic experience for all of the actors involved, but he also includes perspectives from fans and cultural critics. He’s chosen an interesting mix of subjects to interview, and most of them are eager to discuss the enduring legacy of the Brat Pack films and their place (that’s firmly cemented) in cinematic history.

It’s a ton of fun to revisit the actors that defined a generation, but this documentary is so much more than just a nostalgic trip back to the 80s. What makes “Brats” so powerful is the way McCarthy’s introspective journey grows into a deep dive into the psychology and consequences of fame and the weight of labels. The film is a reflection on the power of words and their lasting impact, and is a reminder of how important it is to chose them carefully.

1244890,Sharp Corner,"The mild-mannered “Josh” (Ben Foster), his wife “Rachel” (Cobie Smulders) and their son “Max” (William Kosovic) have a brand new home and are looking forward to settling in when there is a car accident outside and a tyre comes a-bouncing through their window at a seriously inopportune moment! Needless to say they are a bit flustered and she thinks maybe they ought to move. Well when it happens again, you’d think that’d be a bit of a no-brainer but he is somehow captivated. Not by the accidents, but by the time it takes the emergency services to arrive, and so he decides to do some training to be able to help out. Of course, his wife and young son are perplexed by his increasingly odd behaviour, as is his boss, and so there’s soon a lot on the line for the man. I enjoyed the start of this, and I thought this might be Foster’s best performance, but after about half an hour it became a rather joyless exhibition of obsessiveness and selfishness topped off by a truly far-fetched, though sometimes darkly comedic, desire to do good. Smulders does fine, but only features sparingly - which is just as well for given her character is supposed to be a couples therapist, “Rachel” shows a complete lack of appreciation of her husband’s trauma and of their son’s needs that is ultimately annoyingly breathtaking. Sadly, the initially good idea just turns into a series of overly contrived bad decisions stitched together with an implausible series of incidents that rushed through some universally unlikeable and undercooked characterisations and left me wanting more - or less.

1147596,第二十条,"The topic here is quite an interesting one. A CCTV camera captures a man being attacked and stabbed multiple times. The police apprehend the perpetrator, but as the hastily partnered prosecutors - ""Han Ming"" (Jiayin Lei) and ""Liu Lingling"" (Ye Gao) start to investigate, they discover that the victim was actually quite an odious creature who probably deserved his fate - despite the vocal protestations of his family. Meantime, the former is also having some family drama after is son ""Yuchen"" (Liu Yaowen) intervenes in a school bullying incident and finds himself faced with making an humiliating apology or a court-ordered detention. Poor old ""Han"" is now under mounting pressure from his bosses, his partner and from his rather strong-willed wife ""Li Maojuan"" (Li Ma). Juggling plates isn't really his forte, and for most of the drama we vacillate between the increasingly hysterical and bickering marital relationship that starts off quite funny but ends up quite grating, and a police investigation that ultimately has a political point to make about the voracity of Chinese justice to the audience. It does have it's moments, and at times I did feel a bit sorry for ""Han"" as his problems accumulate with no obvious solution for a man who just wants to get to his retirement in one piece. Otherwise, though, it's all a bit messy. The narrative doesn't really flow and it becomes just a but too much of a soap for me as it begins to run out of steam. It is watchable, and at times does raise a smile - but the stories are all just a bit too thin.",6.0
1001083,Pendant ce temps sur Terre,"It’s regrettable when a filmmaker’s reach exceeds his or her grasp. Such is the case, unfortunately, in writer-director Jérémy Clapin’s second feature outing, an ambitious but failed attempt at making a profound statement about the pain of loss and efforts to overcome it when an opportunity presents itself. The film follows the mysterious disappearance of astronaut Franck Martens (Sébastien Pouderoux) while on a seemingly routine space mission, leaving behind his grieving family, most notably his younger sister, Elsa (Megan Northam). She misses her brother terribly but is astounded one evening when she inexplicably appears to be able to communicate with him telepathically. No sooner does she resume contact with him, however, when he disappears again, but this time his voice is supplanted by that of a mysterious alien entity (Dimitri Doré), who says that Franck can be returned home but for a price – the securing of five human hosts for the entity and four colleagues to enable them to come to Earth. Elsa is thus thrust into a moral dilemma: How can she bring about her brother’s return while willfully subjecting five innocent individuals to this kind of involuntary abduction? Who should she choose for such a fate? And is this kind of ransom too high a price to pay? These are intriguing questions, a sound basis for a thoughtful morality play. Sadly, however, the execution of this story is clumsily handled. The filmmaker serves up a story that awkwardly seeks to blend science fiction, horror, psychological drama and metaphysics in a single vehicle, one whose narrative plays more like a collection of concept notes than even a first draft of a working script. The result is a disjointed mix of literal, metaphorical and symbolic themes and imagery, including both animation and live action, that lends itself more to inscrutable ambiguity than meaningful clarity. Perhaps this could have been rectified with a longer runtime to yield more extensive and more cohesive development, but its scant 1:23:00 runtime makes the picture feel rushed and somewhat hurriedly patched together, almost as if the creators tried to incorporate whatever elements they could before the production funding ran out. It’s a shame that this project has turned out as it has, given that it seems to stem from noble intents. However, as it stands now, this is more muddle than insight, a film that falls far short of its lofty, high-minded potential.",5.0
1282960,Detained,"The taut, intense thriller “Detained” is a small-scale crime film that is surprisingly well done. Director and co-writer Felipe Mucci delivers a well-laid-out story with a gripping mystery, presenting an engaging hook from the start. With brisk pacing and a cleverly constructed narrative, this one is an unexpectedly solid genre film that gives off major “True Detective” vibes.

In the middle of the night, Rebecca (Abbie Cornish) wakes up inside a run down police station with no memory of how she got there. Faced with two extremely combative detectives (Laz Alonso, Moon Bloodgood), Rebecca is told that she is being charged with a hit and run. Her already dire situation grows worse after an altercation leads to the death of a fellow inmate and one of the officers. With blood on her hands and no place to turn, she tries to bribe her way out of the escalating mess.

Boosted by solid performances from the entire cast, Cornish is the real standout here, showcasing her depth and versatility. It seems she rarely is given the credit she deserves as an actor, and she effortlessly carries the movie here.

The film’s singular setting is a gimmick that can burden other projects, but it works well here because the tightly conceived story is so meaty. The script is intense and well written, and the mystery is more sophisticated than you’d expect. The narrative jumps around in time but is never confusing and remains easy to follow. The outcome eventually becomes predictable, but the twisty guessing game that makes up the journey there is highly entertaining. Even better, the final reveal and ensuing bloodbath make it all so satisfying.

With a skillfully balanced predictability paired with strong performances and shrewd twists, “Detained” will leave you surprised and entertained.

1234397,Grand Theft Hamlet,"Lockdown played havoc with so many lives, but professionally none more so than those in the entertainment industry. With theatres and cinemas all closed, their livelihoods dried up and a serious degree of ennui crept in to their day to day lives. One escape from that was ""Grand Theft Auto"" and that's where we meet jobbing actors Sam Crane and Mark Oosterveen. Two forty-somethings who were dealing with this situation by shooting as many folks as they could online. The former lives with Pinny and has a couple of kids, the latter lives on his own and is struggling to find some sort of motivation. It's whilst playing the game one day that they find an outdoor auditorium and hit on the idea of performing ""Hamlet"" there. Swiftly they realise that standing on the stage belting out the best of the bard is only going to get their characters shot, then that two folks aren't going to be able to cover all the roles - so they embark on a project to recruit other players to fill the roles. What now ensues sees these men introduced to some serious would-be Thespians, some folks who think he wrote ""Harry Potter"" and some generally eclectic characters who all decide that this can be done after all. I'm not sure Shakespeare could ever have envisaged his play being put on using warplanes or giant blimps whilst the actors faced real peril (though I am sure we've all seen plays on stage where that might have been a benefit!) but as the two men start to become more absorbed with there mission it starts to become just as compelling to watch. Can they do it? How is their obsession impacting on their ""real"" lives? I have never played GTA in my life so was a little apprehensive that not knowing the game might impact on my enjoyment. It didn't at all, indeed that proved quite a fun template for their scenario as the mix of characters they encountered showed quite clearly that these men were not the only ones adrift in a closed-down world.

Then they decide to try to make one themselves, so coax the recipe out of ""Miss Celia"" (Colleen Baum) and head to the supermarket to ""borrow"" the ingredients. The last, most vital, speckled eggs is stolen from under their nose by ""Redrye"" (Charles Halford). They're not having any of this so follow him home so they can pinch them back, only to find he is part of a gang led by ""Anna-Freya"" (Lio Tipton), a witch of sorts, who is determined to kill the 'Prince of the Forest"" (a grand and majestic old stag). Luckily for our intrepid trio, her daughter ""Petal"" (Lorelei Olivia Mote) had snuck out on the hunting trip and soon the four children are using all of their guile to thwart the plans of her mother whilst still getting that elusive egg for the pie! The four children deliver engagingly here with ""Alice"" (Phoebe Ferro - or maybe a young Dame Anna Wintour) taking charge, Mote enjoying her spell as the mischievous mini-witch and the scene stealing ""Jodie"" (Skyler Peters). He's the youngest of the group and the most entertaining. The writing quirkily mixes some modern day language with some fun use of Arthurian style ye, thee and whences and when did you last hear a kid (or anyone) use the word scurries?

The playwright’s debut feature, to put it simply, is boring, pretentious, meandering, unfocused and a big, fat waste of time. It’s so dull, in fact, that the film makes the works of Kelly Reichardt appear utterly fascinating. Set in 1991 in the hippie-dominated arts community of rural western Massachusetts, the film follows the story (if one could even call it that) of middle-aged acupuncturist Janet (Julianne Nicholson) as she struggles to sort out what appears to have been a wayward, meandering life. And, as this tale plays out, it faithfully sticks to that course, too, an influence that’s clearly wearing off on Janet’s equally clueless, incessantly brooding, 8-year-old daughter, Lacy (newcomer Zoe Ziegler). Along the way, the duo experiences an array of cryptic, inconsequential involvements with others who are apparently fascinated with Janet (though goodness knows why), all of whom (Will Patton, Sophie Okonedo, Elias Koteas) are just as lost and boring as Janet is. So what’s the point in all this? Who knows – and, not long into the picture, who cares? The raves that have been showered on this tedious, tiresome piece of filmmaking are a complete mystery to me, given its prevailing mundane nature and monotone performances by players who all sound like they’ve been shot up with sodium pentothal. Nicholson, in particular, comes across as so disengaged that she probably could have just as easily phoned in this performance (despite claims that this is the breakthrough role that she’s supposedly been waiting for – please, watch her in “August: Osage County” (2013) instead). What’s more, this picture probably has some of the worst sound quality I’ve ever seen in a contemporary production – so bad that I had to struggle to be able to hear what was being said (and I was sitting in the theater’s second row). And the film’s feeble attempts at trying to incorporate some kind of subtle, nuanced metaphysical undercurrent fail miserably as well, treated almost as if their inclusion was an afterthought. If you dare to consider giving this one a look, make sure you don’t watch it when you’re tired – you just might fall asleep soon after the opening credits roll, an understandable reaction, to be sure.",2.0
1037035,Janet Planet,"A story about a mom and daughter in an awkwardly semi-erotic relationship.

The mom starts a relationship with a mentally ill and mentally disabled white man with a speech impediment. We never get to know why or how she hooked up with him. We know she peddles woo for a living, so she hasn't met him in some kind of caretaker/patient relationship. Perhaps it's a fetish. Perhaps it was all she could get.

Well, they mow their lawn and sit around trying to say as little as possible, helped by the guy's aforementioned speech impediment. Sometimes the girl plays her Casio.

They meet up with the guy's daughter from another unexplained relationship after first standing a minute by their car, then two minutes staring in silence about thirty feet away from the daughter. The two girls play.

Then the ill guy gets a headache, and the mom breaks up with him. The mom and daughter then go to some kind of religious communist hippie seance thing for about half an hour, where they first appropriate what looks like maybe Indian culture, then talk about how the culture of others is evil and nihilistic and how they're better than everyone else.

The mom then starts a lesbian relationship with a black woman, who's also into woo. The black lesbian lets us know that the mom is a fantastic woman, which is really helpful, because she's only been shown so far as a somewhat unstable questionable mom with terrible judgment.

The black lesbian, thankfully, is pretty cool and has her shit together. She can also speak, a trait she uses on the daughter, who by the way talks like a thirty-year-old most of the time. Maybe the mom goes on Tinder for her lesbian hookups instead of driving around homeless areas when looking for a straight hookup.

Then they take a bath, watch some TV, talk about themselves, and delve into teenage Weltschmertz-level pocket philosophy for about half an hour. In the end, the black lesbian agrees with the mom in the wrong way, and the mom goes into a mentally abusive tirade, possibly due to some kind of psychosis.

Then the daughter eats an ice cream for about five minutes. When she comes home, one of the weirdos from the hippie commune is there and asks awkward questions for awhile. The daughter then sits on the couch for about five minutes looking at a doll, then plays piano for another five minutes, and finally looks at weirdo guy talking to black lesbian girl without sound for a long time. Weirdo guy abduct lesbian black woman in his beetle bus.

At night, when mom and daughter are doing whatever it is they're up to in bed, the daughter reveals that she's a lesbian. Mom says she kinda suspected it, because the way she is as a person probably wouldn't work with a man, so it'd be easier to just be lesbian. Which of course is incredibly insensitive and disrespectful, but the daughter seems fine with it. The mom then disregards the subject and starts talking about herself, and how she's so amazing that she could make any man in the world fall in love with her. Maybe this narcissism is a biproduct of her mental health problems, but we can only guess. Her tremendously inappropriate oversharing lasts for about five minutes, and then thankfully the scene is over.

In act three, creepy weirdo guy returns and shares his cringe misconceptions about cosmology and the big bang, mixed in a blender with Buddhist misunderstandings.

Then the daughter and mom go for a walk and the mom shares thoughts on how she doesn't understand how other people work, in particular men. It escalates into a sort of religiously induced mental breakdown that for some reason doesn't freak out the daughter. Perhaps she's seen this sort of thing much too often and has learned over the years to disassociate and compartmentalize.

The daughter then gets a headache and lies around for about twelve hundred hours. The mom now wants creepy weirdo Deepak Chopra cosmology guy's penis for some reason, and as is her apparent habit, she makes the daughter make the decision for her if it's okay to hook up with him. Just as she habitually makes it the daughter's decision when she breaks up with someone. Guess she doesn't want to carry the burden herself of her poor decisions. Much better to let her nine-year-old daughter deal with that guilt.

The mom and Deepak Chopra now go for a walk for six years, two of which are spent by Deepak as he reads from a book under a tree. Mom ""spaced out in the middle,"" as she puts it, and asks him to read it again. Which. He. Does. Literally. For two more years.

Mr. Chopra then vanishes into thin air, and mom spends about a millennium sitting under a tree confused, then driving home while eating chicken in the beetle bang bus.

The last ten minutes are spent watching people dance, and the daughter very very slowly cracking from the pressure of the mental abuse she's suffered at the hand of her mom.

The end.

Oh, and it's an A24 production, so audio is mono and it's filmed in AnusVision, left to fade in the sun, the blacks crushed, the brights crushed, the brightness turned down  to 20% so you can't see what's going on, contrast to 10% so it's as dull as the colors are faded, the black level then lifted to 5% so dark scenes are gray scenes, then dragged through a latrine for grittiness and developed and scanned by a blind drunkard.

I really like many A24 films. But this narcissistic, pretentious, navel-gazing, frankly unintelligent, woke, forced, pathetically and clumsily scaffolded, boring and predictable garbage is NOT it. Damn, what a chore to get through. Not a single likeable character. The daughter comes close, but is so poorly written by someone who forgot what it's like to be a child, and doesn't have one of their own, nor knows anyone who does, that she's just completely unbelievable. A very small number of the ridiculously long and dwelling shots actually work, and the acting by the mom is passable, so it's a very low two-star rating.",2.0
1037035,Janet Planet,"Writer / director Annie Baker‘s slow burn indie film “Janet Planet” is one that takes its time, and whether that works for you really depends on your mood. This super quiet, artsy, coming-of-age movie tells the story of 11-year-old Lacy (Zoe Ziegler) and her free-spirited mom, Janet (Julianne Nicholson), who live in rural Massachusetts in the early ‘90s. The movie is about their highly relatable, complex relationship as Lacy grows up and starts pulling away from her mom. This is an experiential type of film that’s more about the vibe and the little moments than a straightforward plot.

What I really liked about this movie is how it feels like you’re just sitting with the characters in their quiet little world. Sounds of nature make up the majority of the soundtrack, which makes you focus on what’s going on between between Lacy and Janet (and their changing dynamic). With its deliberate, ambling pacing, the film can feel pretty slow at times. You really need to be in the right mindset to enjoy its quirks.

Ziegler’s performance as Lacy is a big highlight. She’s an odd, tough little girl who’s figuring out life in her own weird way. Her character is weirdly mature and often has deep conversations with adults as she quietly manipulates the people around her. It’s a complex role, and Ziegler is impressive in it. Nicholson is also perfectly cast as Janet, a mom who’s more of a friend than a parent. These two actors work well together, adding deeper layers to the complicated relationship that divides their characters.

“Janet Planet” is an offbeat story about trying your best to fit in with the world, especially when everyone else sees you as a stranger on the outside looking in. The film is slow and introspective, but it beautifully captures a deep dive into human dynamics and the very real pains of growing up.

1214539,Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat,"This documentary is a serious testament to the archivist's art as it pieces together an impressive array of imagery of the great and the good of American Jazz and combines that with some intimate actuality of the turbulence ongoing in the Congo as it strived for independence. Why might anyone care about the future of an impoverished African nation that had all but bankrupted it's ""owner"" - King Leopold II of Belgium? Well that's because it holds enormous deposits of the uranium required by both the West and the Soviets - and that's just the start of it's reputedly $23 trillion worth of mineral assets. Emerging from the populace to lead this new country is Patrice Lumumba. He's an articulate man who unlike so many who took their nations out of colonial-hood, is not constantly bedecked in medals and ribbons with armed men at his back. What we see over the next couple of hours uses a superb musical soundtrack from the likes of Nina Simone, Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis - you name it, to provide a backdrop to CIA shenanigans, petulant strops from Nikita Khruschev, accusatory comments from just about everyone from Malcolm X to Fidel Castro and some extremely cynical insights into the Eisenhower presidency's approach to this man; to the problems he may bring or solve and to the precedents he was bound to set. As you'll expect, this freedom fight is tied-in closely with the fight for desegregation and equal/human rights for African American people and it uses that platform to illustrate just how ineffective the US-dominated United Nations was at brokering anything akin to a peaceable solution that was in anyway neutral or beneficial to the populace of this vast territory. The secession of Katanga - where the mining was at it's more lucrative and the privatisation of it's principal enterprise ensured that the West still pulled the strings, sets the tone for the final phase of the history and it's tragic conclusion. I knew some of this but I wasn't aware of just how exploitatively the American administration used unwitting people, many globally recognised household hames and who were still treated as second-class citizens (if citizens at all) at home, to peddle a political message of brotherhood and unity in Africa and at just how effective these deceptions were whilst the CIA experimented with new ways of assassinating. There's an arrogance here that's writ large as the local population are treated with a casual disdain that makes your flesh crawl. Fans of jazz will love the accompaniment which mixes some characterful performances of the more famous pieces of music from the genre with some more specifically written and delivered themes that directly address the issues of slavery, exploitation and freedom that led to a protest within the impotent General Assembly chamber itself. It is curious that many of the criticisms levelled at the UN in the mid 1960s are just as valid today, and that little progress as been made changing the format that was established by world powers in the 1940s whose ""permanent"" roles embedded in the political infrastructure remain unaffected sixty years later. This isn't a film about corporate greed, it's one about political influence and domination and has been thoughtfully put together to open a hornet's nest. Did you know that Dizzy Gillespie actually ran for US President?",7.0
1214539,Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat,"Perhaps the most important objective of a documentary is to shed light on a subject and make it comprehensible and insightful for viewers, especially when it involves little-known material. However, when it comes to writer-director Johan Grimonprez’s latest offering, that goal is sorely compromised in multiple respects. The film examines (or, more precisely, attempts to examine) the complex history of the Congo’s struggle for independence from its Belgian colonial masters and the emergence of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba as a global influencer in the 1950s and early 1960s. The fledgling, resource-rich nation became a flashpoint in international politics on various fronts, including the Cold War between East and West, the rise of the pan-African movement, the ongoing decline of colonial imperialism and the role of the United Nations in global affairs. Its impact also extended into American politics, particularly the birth and growth of the civil rights movement and its impact on leaders like Malcolm X, as well as the Eisenhower Administration’s veiled efforts at protecting the status quo, especially through seemingly benign cultural programs like goodwill exchanges involving popular Black jazz musicians. Many threads are thus involved in telling this tale, but, regrettably, they’re not coherently managed, particularly in the picture’s opening hour (of a surprisingly and arguably somewhat needlessly overlong 2:30:00 runtime). The filmmaker throws a lot of widely diverse material at his audience without coherent, meaningful explanation, and much of that involves reading a series of cryptic screen graphics that fly by hastily with little elaboration, a process that quickly becomes aggravating, frustrating and tiresome, even for the most adept subtitle readers. Then there’s the jazz aspect of this release, whose connection to the narrative isn’t always made clear or relevant, despite its addition of an element of artistic flair. However, these performance sequences – as entertaining and poignant as they are – ultimately do more to promote the film’s style than its substance, To its credit, “Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat” becomes more cogent (albeit somewhat politically oversimplified) as it moves forward, but, by that point, audiences may well have lost patience with it (I was admittedly on the verge of turning it off myself after the opening 60 minutes, something I generally never do). It’s also obvious that the material here was exceedingly well researched and incorporates a wealth of revelatory archive footage, both from journalistic and jazz performance sources, qualities definitely worthy of commendation. However, a more fluid, better organized telling of this tale (especially one that doesn’t skip around out of temporal sequence) would have helped immeasureably, as would have a better elucidated nexus between its political and musical aspects. There’s clearly an important story to be told here, but this isn’t the vehicle for doing so.",5.0
1125073,Between the Temples,"""Cantor Ben"" (Jason Schwartzman) has recently become a widower and is struggling to get on with his job working for Rabbi ""Bruce"" (Robert Smigel) at the Sinai Synagogue. He has one too many chocolate-laced ""Mudslingers"" in a bar one evening and that leads to an altercation that leads to a reunion with ""Carla"" (Carol Kane). Though neither recall immediately, it transpires that she used to be his childhood music teacher. Next thing we know, she has turned up at his synagogue where she declares her Jewish heritage and that she wishes to have her Bat Mitzvah. I didn't know that took over year to study and prepare for, and neither did she - but after a bit of convincing, he is cajoled into preparing her and the story picks up the pace as, predictably but not in a predictable fashion, the two start to bond. ""Ben"" lives with his two mothers - ""Judith"" (Dolly De Leon) and ""Meira"" (Caroline Aaron) who are keen on him settling down again with a nice girl, and to that end they try to set him up with the Rabbi's daughter ""Gabby"" (Madeline Weinstein) but somehow we just know that this solution that would please friends and family alike isn't likely to be the one he goes for. It's not especially innovative, this film - we've seen this sort of drama often before. What this does, though, is entertainingly take a look at the contractions of tradition and at belligerence. It invites us to consider what makes people happy, why age matters, and two dinner scenario towards the end provide for quite an effective conduit for true colours to come out and judgements to be delivered. It's comedic rather than a comedy - there aren't any laugh-out-loud moments; with the writing quite potent at times and an enjoyable rapport developing between the two characters uncertain of their next move. Kane steals this with her delicate delivery of a strong yet venerable persona, and although it does strive to contrive once or twice, it's still quite an enjoyable look at hypocrisy and faith and kosher burgers.",7.0
1125073,Between the Temples,"The burdens of rules, conventions and traditions can weigh heavily on us, especially when they’re not serving us, allowing us to be ourselves or taking much of the joy out of life. The impact can affect us in many ways, too, including emotionally, psychologically, spiritually, physically and socially. So it is for Benjamin Gottlieb (Jason Schwartzman), a disillusioned forty-something cantor/Bat Mitzvah instructor at a conservative synagogue north of New York. He’s experiencing a crisis of faith as a result of the rough year he’s recently undergone, having lost his wife and now facing the prospect of losing his voice (and his livelihood). He’s also had to move in with his two well-meaning but overbearing mothers (Caroline Aaron, Dolly De Leon), who perpetually try to fix him up with new romantic interests. His boss, Rabbi Bruce (Robert Smigel), has also tried playing matchmaker, trying to connect Ben with his aggressively randy daughter, Gabby (Madeline Weinstein). But these efforts only place even more pressure on him, pushing hm to the brink. Strangely enough, though, circumstances begin turning around when he has a chance encounter with his quirky retired grade school music teacher, Carla Kessler (Carol Kane). She’s anxious to become one of Ben’s Bat Mitzvah students, given that she was denied this rite of passage in her youth. He reluctantly begins instructing her, but he soon starts learning as much from her as she does from him, most notably how to let loose, be himself and enjoy life, traits that others look down upon him for when he breaks with expectations. Nevertheless, considering their respective mindsets, this relationship netween Ben and Carla proves to be exactly what they each need. Writer-director Nathan Silver’s latest feature provides us with a touching, irreverent look at how to live a life that’s both spiritually and secularly fulfilling in the face of oppressing outside influences, particularly when it comes to knowing when to follow and when to break the rules. The protagonist’s unconventional odyssey takes him – and viewers – down an array of unexpected paths, with lots of laughs and eccentric experiences. Unfortunately, there are times when the filmmaker takes matters a little too far, infusing the narrative with a few too many different storytelling approaches and filming styles, making the picture overall somewhat disjointed and incoherent. These inventive attempts at originality, while certainly commendable, tend to get in the way of yielding a cohesive storyline, regardless of the many chuckles they evoke. The duo of Schwartzman and Kane, backed by a fine ensemble of supporting players, valiantly endeavor to make the material work, sometimes successfully, sometimes futilely. The sentiments explored here are indeed noble, and the film’s commitment to an unanticipated approach to its subject matter is truly laudable, but the creators seriously should have reined themselves in more than they have here. Doing so would have made for a better movie, not to mention greater clarity on an important life lesson from which we could all stand to benefit.",6.0
1122618,Good One,"I think maybe son “Dylan” (a fleeting appearance from Julian Grady) might have had the right idea when he decides to opt out of his dad’s camping trip with his best friend and his daughter. Seems that “Matt” (Danny McCarthy) is having father-son issues amidst a divorce after he strayed with someone quite a bit younger. His travelling companions are lifelong buddy (James Le Gros) and teenage “Sammy” (Lily Collias) who have a more typical relationship. She has known “Matt” for years and for a while their trip, trekking through the beautiful Catskill mountains, seems to pass off amiably enough. They even meet some fellow travellers for some who has been where grandstanding; the tents seems to go up without any slapstick and there’s a little teasing about the nature of her relationship with “Jessie”. “Matt” however, begins to feel a bit melancholy though as he gradually beings to appreciate that his family is disintegrating and after a revealing conversation with “Sammy” and an even more revealing and wholly inadequate one she has with her father afterwards, it becomes pretty clear that she is not without her own problems and her father has quite a bit of growing up of his own to do. It’s a very slowly paced drama this, with most of the dialogue delivered as naturally occurring conversation. That works to an extent as sentences are left unfinished and inferences are made using facial expressions, but what is missing here is any sense of development of these people. We are left to make too many assumptions which rather lets the thing down as the story heads to it’s crunch moment. That rather comes out of the blue and seems contrived to make the very point the auteur wants to make despite it not really fitting the profile or behaviour of the characters we had hitherto been walking through the wilderness with. I suppose, without giving the game away, I just don’t agree with the fundamental message that the latter stages of the film seem to be trying to convey here and so was ultimately a bit disappointed that what started off as an light-hearted, quite wittily scripted, observation of family became something a little subliminally sinister for the sake of it. It’s a gorgeous film to watch and Collias delivers engagingly, too, but films like this risk fuelling a growing misconception of an opportunistic or even predatory male stereotype that most men simply won’t accept and isn’t actually true.",6.0
1110390,तेरी बातों में ऐसा उलझा जिया,"Shahid and Kriti's breezy, whacky Rom-Com had immense potential but stumbles due to a lackluster script

""Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya"" offers a desi twist to the romantic comedy genre with a sci-fi touch, distinguishing itself from Hollywood counterparts. While the AI concept brings a whacky idea, the film falters due to mediocre writing, lacking a solid payoff or satisfactory ending. Shahid Kapoor's relaxed charm and magical dance sequences elevate the film, though the direction falls short. Kriti Sanon shines, balancing AI objectivity and warmth in an illogical yet entertaining love story. The noteworthy music, especially ""Akhiyaan Gulaab"" and ""Tum Se,"" earns a place in playlists. Despite lacking top-tier humor, the film serves as a harmless rom-com for Valentine's, particularly for the hopeless romantics.


Full Review :

**Screenplay:**
""Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya"" unfolds with a breezy and harmless romantic comedy screenplay, introducing a unique desi twist to the sci-fi genre. The film maintains a light-hearted tone throughout, preventing the audience from taking it too seriously. However, the AI concept, while whacky, suffers from mediocre writing, leading to occasional drags and an ultimately unsatisfactory ending. The family dynamics portrayed are average, lacking the depth seen in recent dramas. The screenplay struggles to provide a solid payoff, leaving the audience wanting more substance and resolution.

**Performances:**
Shahid Kapoor shines with charm and delivers magical dance sequences, showcasing a relaxed side post his intense roles. Despite the half-baked direction, his performance stands out, adding an enjoyable vibe to the film. Kriti Sanon steals the show, skillfully balancing AI objectivity and warmth in this illogical yet entertaining love story. Her portrayal demonstrates restraint and class, preventing the character from descending into slapstick territory. Supporting roles, particularly Shahid and Kriti's, contribute to the film's overall appeal, but the potential of the cast is hindered by the screenplay's limitations.

**Music:**
The film boasts noteworthy music that becomes a highlight. Tracks like ""Akhiyaan Gulaab"" and ""Tum Se"" set the tone with their vibrant beats, making them standouts. The sensational Varun Jain's humming in ""Tum Se"" and the full-vibe ""Akhiyaan Gulaab"" by Mitraaz add a delightful touch to the soundtrack. ""Laal Peeli Akhiyaan"" carries the right beats for a party cracker. The score, overall, is beautifully composed, earning a spot in the audience's playlists. The musical elements enhance the film's entertainment value, providing a treat for the ears and contributing significantly to its overall charm.

890116,मेरी क्रिसमस,"Merry Christmas is satisfying Sriram Raghavan venture with a deliciously crafted romance in form of sumptuous mystery

My Rating : 80/100

Sriram Raghavan unique style of presenting dark humour and crime is separate genre in itself. After films like Andhadhun, Badlapur made for matured audience , he delivers a Christmas project which is thoroughly enticing and entertaining. Merry Christmas is satisfying one night story of 2 strangers attracted towards each other which turns out to be a bloody thriller post interval. The film falls in a niche category of slow burn thrillers which demands attention and not for people looking for engagement in every frame. The first half is purely a setup in progress for a wild ride coming in 2nd half. Powered by brilliant Vijay Sethupathy, a formidable Katrina and a tightly edited runtime , Sriram Raghavan delivers a film which has a solid heart and fitting climax which makes worth all the wait.The music is magical by Pritam especially the songs Nazar Teri Toofan by Papon and Raat Akeli Thi by Arijit. Beautifully integrated into the screenplay. 

I was apprehensive about  pairing of Vijay and Katrina but how beautifully and organically the romance is presented in the first half is what makes Raghavan Sir a celebrated director. Vijay Sethupathy with his distinct sarcastic humour and sharp expressions wins me over again. While Katrina has shown great command over her hindi dialogues and has also given a performance she would later be proud of. Vinay Pathak and Pratima Kannan in an extended cameo make the film interestingly exciting towards the climax. Baby  Pari Sharmaos adorable. 

Overall, there are few things to keep in mind before you watch Merry Christmas. Don't compare with Andhadhun, its an entirely different story. Don't completely tag it as a thriller, its a romantic comedy which turns into dark thriller. The film needs more mature audience to watch it. It wont work for everyone but I really appreciate the neo noirism integrations by Raghavan Sir with multiple twists and wow monents in 2nd half.

1171861,The Last Repair Shop,"This is quite an engaging documentary that introduces us to four specialist technicians who maintain some of the musical instruments that are provided free to pupils in the Los Angeles school system. Prefaced by a few words from each of the children who benefit from the violins, tubas, pianos and saxophones to name but a few, we then meet four of the people - from a variety of interesting, sometimes quite traumatic, backgrounds - as they show us just how meticulously they work to keep these instruments alive and useful. To be honest, I could have been doing with just a little more performance from the would-be students, but these characters who put their heart and soul into preserving these musical tools come across as dedicated and passionate. The same can be said for the students - especially the young violinist at the start whose smile just about says it all. We end with a rousing section from the alumni of students who have benefitted over the years and this is a fine testament to the role of music in an education system that doesn't just focus on the academic.",7.0
1067485,Sebastian,"Authors striving for authenticity in their work often engage in extensive background research, sometimes of a firsthand nature, to get things right. However, when it comes to writer-director Mikko Mäkelä’s second (and inexplicably much-applauded) feature, I have some serious reservations about its applicability here. This tale of a talented young London-based author of award-winning short stories and magazine pieces is embarking on his first novel, an inside exposé of the lives of gay male sex workers. To find out what these experiences are like, the ambitious emerging wordsmith, Max Williamson (Ruaridh Mollica), decides to investigate the subject by becoming an escort, arranging hook-ups through an internet website under the pseudonym “Sebastian.” But, the more involved he becomes in his research, the more he becomes consumed by it, unsure how to keep control over it. Strangely, though, there are also times when he’s apparently ambivalent about it, going to great lengths to keep both his hustling work – and even his sexuality – a secret. Is he trying to keep from being discovered by his clients and writing peers, or is he a closet case who, quite ironically, hasn’t fully come to accept himself (not even coming out to his own family)? In any event, he engages in a string of diverse encounters that leave him – and viewers – wondering about exactly where he’s going with all this, including a somewhat baffling, unexpected budding romance with an older gentleman (Jonathan Hyde). This plethora of mixed motivations is where the film gets itself into trouble, hopelessly meandering in multiple, seemingly contradictory directions, raising questions about what the filmmaker/screen writer actually had in mind, as well as how diligent he was in doing his homework in crafting the story. “Sebastian” thus often comes across like a series of sexual escapades with a poorly conceived story wrapped about them, many of which end up falling back on well-worn, outdated gay cautionary tale tropes. The film also incorporates some implausible developments involving the publishing business, stretching the picture’s credibility even further. In light of this, then, it’s hard to fathom how and why this offering has received as many accolades as it has, especially as a potential candidate for awards season recognition. In my view, this release needs major retooling, not only to provide a more focused narrative, but also to strengthen its character development to something more believable and something that generates a more viable audience connection. To be sure, there are many fine LGBTQ+ movies out there these days that are genuinely worthy of praise and recognition – but this overrated production certainly isn’t one of them.",5.0
1067485,Sebastian,"“Max” (Ruaridh Mollica) juggles a career as an aspiring journalist and novelist with charging £200 per hour selling his services as an escort to, mainly, older men. His boyish good looks and obvious inexperience at the latter makes him popular and he proves successful enough to use his varied experiences to form the basis of his book. His publisher likes the freshness and intimacy of the adventures of “Sebastian” but a rather self-induced setback at work forces a change to the dynamic of both his life and his work. Though there is the odd sex scene to enliven the drama, the rest of this is all a rather shallow investigation of the high-end comfort market and whilst Mollica is easy enough on the eye his performance over-relies on that and is quite lacklustre. The story itself has quite a few gaps that don’t quite add up; timelines don’t quite track and by the conclusion I actually thought that instead of offering us some sort of critical observation of an industry that transcends just about every aspect of society, we ended up with more of a rather exploitative - cruel, even, character about whom I really didn’t care so much after a while. Jonathan Hyde brings a bit of (rather sad) nuance to the proceedings but Ingvar Sigurdsson’s “Daniel” seemed just too Jekkyl and Hyde to be plausible at quite a crucial juncture in the young man’s increasingly light-weight story. Rather than a movie, this might have made for a better three-part drama that could have focussed a little more cohesively on the aspects of his life, love and self-evaluation but as it is, it’s all too bitty. Worth a watch, but not what it could have been.",6.0

Unbeknown to his parents, though, teenage son ""Michael"" has smuggled their dog ""Stella"" aboard and is feeding her from their supply of digestive biscuits! Of course this isn't a secret he can keep for long, and actually it shows us that ""Michael"" isn't actually the most grown up of boys as he seems to view parental instructions more like optional guidelines.

There's no food, no water - and a baking sun, so you wouldn't think much for his chances - except.

Well the jellyfish certainly have it in for him, and that's when he meets his benefactor - an old gent who would appear to have been on the island for a very long time.

Desperate for rescue when he arrived - is he still so desperate now? We learn a little of the backstory of the island's sole human occupant which adds some richness, and some sadness, to two straightforwardly engaging characterisations and with an animation that reminded me a little, in style, of the ""Snowman"" (1982) and a fitting musical accompaniment from Stuart Hancock I found this to be a short, sweet and enjoyably poignant story of learning a little about self-reliance and not so much about self-importance.",7.0

1005972,Hypnosen,"Sometimes we can all use a little help in changing our behavior when we aren’t able to do so on our own, and hypnosis is one of the most commonly employed practices. But, in some cases, it can work so well that we may unintentionally end up overcompensating, prompting us to act out in ways that yield a whole new crop of issues to contend with. Such is the case with Vera (Asta Kamma August), who gives hypnosis a try to quit smoking, a behavior she regards as unhealthy and antisocial. However, Vera’s hypnotherapist (Karin de Frumerie) suspects that her patient’s reluctance in explaining her reasons for seeking out treatment suggests that she’s there for more than just kicking the habit. This hunch leads her to conduct a profoundly impactful hypnotherapy session that produces a radical, albeit somewhat ill-defined, change in her subject’s behavior. And, even though Vera seems to relish the effects of this change, it couldn’t have come at a worse time: just as Vera and her business and romantic partner, André (Herbert Nordrum), are about to pitch their new commercial venture to a group of select international investors at an elite pitch fest, an event where they receive guidance from a high-profile pitch coach (David Fukamachi Regnfors). During preparation for their presentation, Vera begins acting strangely unpredictably, even disorderly, toward others, including those whom she and André are most trying to win over. So what’s going on here? And what, if anything, can André do to salvage matters before everything falls apart? Writer-director Ernst De Geer’s delightfully quirky debut feature takes a humorously absurdist look at questions of social conformity, particularly when it comes to differentiating behavior that’s gleefully playful from that which is wholly unacceptable, especially in earnestly serious “grown-up” situations. It accomplishes this goal through a captivating mix of hilariously dry wit and cringeworthy drama, one that often makes viewers squirm while questioning exactly what’s going on. In fact, at times, the mix can be perplexing enough that audiences may be uncomfortably puzzled by what’s transpiring on the screen and what the director is going for – that is, until the surfacing of the big reveal, the one that exposes the source behind the emergence of Vera’s erratic behavior, one that plants a rollicking punctuation mark on this often-uproarious offering. Much of the credit for this goes to the film’s fine script and its superb ensemble cast, particularly protagonists August and Nordrum, who play off each other well and create a wry sense of humorously driven dramatic tension. I love movies that make it a point to stick pins in sanctimonious balloons and push over sacred cows, and this one does as good a job at that as I’ve seen in a while. “The Hypnosis” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but I’m only too happy to take more than a few good sips. Pass the milk and lemon, please.",8.0
1220515,Treasure,"American journalist ""Ruth"" (Lena Dunham) had long planned a trip from the USA to her ancestral home in Poland only to find her effervescent father ""Edek"" (Stephen Fry) has decided to join her. A fluent speaker and full of a slightly annoying joie de vivre, they embark on a trip to the tourist sites, but that's not what she wants. She wants to head to the family home in Łódź where they were a successful industrial family before the Nazi's confiscated their wealth, property and sent ""Edek"" and his wife to Auschwitz. What is clear is that dad is not so keen on this itinerary, nor is he at all keen on train travel - and the remainder of the film takes us on a family journey that will open the eyes of the daughter whilst bringing back the demons for the father. This tries quite effectively at times to introduce some humour into what is quite an emotional topic, especially when their trip does eventually take them (and us) to his haunting place of incarceration where he finds a flood of memories readily come back to him. Fry over-eggs the accent a bit, but he does manage to convey something of the harrowing nature of his incarceration, and of his mind's determination to protect itself from opening that door to trauma again. Dunham also serves well enough as his independently-minded daughter to support that increasingly troubled characterisation. It's quite a poignant drama that encourages us, as D-Day 80 is still fresh in the mind - to imagine the horrors visited on the Polish people by the Nazis and to realise that in many cases (this is set in 1991) their houses and businesses were still pretty much as they were left in 1941 - only largely dilapidated and with new, poverty-stricken occupants. I did rather like the conclusion - it poses quite an interesting question about what we might do in her place. As a drama, it maybe doesn't need the cinema, but the photography at the now silenced death camp is still blood-curdling.",7.0

1136423,மெய்யழகன்,"Reconnecting with people we were earlier forced to part ways with. That's the central theme of Prem Kumar Chandran's Debut & Sophomore Directionals. Like 96 (2018), he has a done wonderful job yet again in liberating the suppressed emotions of closeted protagonists. 

Meiyazhagan (2024) is an Arvind Swami film starring Karthi but despite appearing late in the film, Karthi owned every scene he was part of. 

He is what you call a perfect spontaneous actor, Vijay Sethupathi comes close to him with his own set of performances in the same terrain but VJS was just VJS in most of them while Karthi exhibits his spontaneity with distinct behavioral patterns for each character he plays even If they have similar looks.  

Prem Kumar presents Meiyazhagan (2024) like a visualized novel akin to reading Swami and Friends by RK Narayan. The 2nd half of the film is largely conversational but remained engaging for the most part except for minor slurps in segments where Arvind Swami & Karthi sing Ilaiyaraaja songs. 

I don't know If its due to watching the trimmed version but I felt no significant lag at any point, not even in the supposed weaker parts of the film. 

Meiyazhagan (2024) is a film to be cherished, it may not be a major box office success like 96 (2018) but its a definite relief from reels driven cinema. It doesn't resort to inorganic adrenaline rush or emotional manipulation, the film is content with being a grounded fairy tale for adults. It will deeply resonate with people who were born into joint families on the verge of disintegration.

1108828,गर्ल्स विल बी गर्ल्स,"The coming of age process is different for everyone, and that’s especially true for those of different generations. Those who underwent this rite of passage years ago, however, arguably may have faced more challenges and restrictions than what’s present in these more liberated and open-minded times, and such individuals may be somewhat envious of the privileges that have been afforded their younger counterparts. That’s very much the case with Anila (Kani Kusruti) and her teenage daughter, Mira (Preeti Panigrahi), who has (or at least should have) a comparatively easier time with this than her mother did. Nevertheless, Anila still expects Mira to conform to the rigid standards of her own youth, enrolling her in a strict Himalayan boarding school and hovering around her like an overprotective helicopter parent, particularly when she befriends a young man, Sri (Kesav Binoy Kiron), who becomes a budding – if severely restricted – romantic interest. Despite these constraints, though, Mira is supremely curious to clandestinely explore her emerging sexuality and female drives while at least superficially maintaining the image of propriety expected of a young Indian girl. Matters become further complicated, however, when Anila takes more than a passing supervisory interest in her daughter’s new beau, a dynamic that produces added friction between mother and daughter. As if adolescence weren’t complicated enough in itself, these circumstances raise the tension level inside the family household, in the relationship between the two youngsters and in the mind of someone who’s trying to figure out her life under conditions fraught with confusion, contradiction, constraint and more than a few double standards. Writer-director Shuchi Talati’s debut feature takes a nuanced, mature look at what can often be a baffling time of life, one that’s made even more complex by the potent influences impacting it. The film tends to fizzle somewhat as it approaches its conclusion, almost as if the director doesn’t quite know how to wrap up the story. But that doesn’t hinder the production overall when it comes to covering some previously unexplored fertile ground when it comes to a subject that’s often handled tritely and riddled with clichés. This recipient of two Independent Spirit Awards – for Kusruti’s supporting performance and as a candidate for the competition’s John Cassavetes Award – definitely makes a mark among 2024’s releases, even if, as the premiere offering from a new filmmaker, it could use some shoring up at times. That aside, though, “Girls Will Be Girls” is an impressive start for a promising new auteur, one well worth streaming online. Indeed, through this work, audiences may never view the coming of age process in quite the same way ever again.",7.0
1098709,Grand Tour,"Miguel Gomes's ""Grand Tour"" stands as one of the most creatively audacious films in recent memory, fully deserving of the Best Director prize at Cannes 2024. Drawing inspiration from W. Somerset Maugham's ""The Gentleman in the Parlour"" and ""Mabel,"" Gomes crafts something wholly original – a cinematic tapestry that weaves together travelogue, love story, comedy, and philosophical meditation with breathtaking virtuosity.

The film's premise seems deceptively simple: Edward, a spineless British civil servant in 1917 Burma, flees on the eve of his wedding, while his joyful, determined fiancée Molly pursues him across Asia. But Gomes transforms this framework into a profound exploration of intimacy, connection, and cultural perspective.

What initially appears as a period piece gradually reveals itself as something far more complex. The accumulating anachronisms – modern footage interspersed with studio sets, contemporary sounds bleeding into period scenes – aren't mistakes but intentional artistic choices. Gomes collapses time, creating a dialogue between colonial past and postcolonial present that interrogates how we perceive both history and the ""exotic.""

The emotional core of ""Grand Tour"" lies in its exquisite portrayal of two souls moving through the same spaces at different times. Edward's journey represents fear of intimacy and commitment, while Molly's pursuit embodies unwavering devotion. Their separate but parallel journeys become a metaphorical dance, played out against stunning landscapes and cultural encounters. The film transforms from screwball comedy to something profoundly moving as these halves converge toward the astonishing final sequence.

I'm quite partial to magic surrealism, and although Grand Tour isn't quite that genre, it's at least a fraternal sibling. Gomes employs every cinematic tool available – the voiceovers in multiple Asian languages, the stunning black and white photography, the brilliant musical selections ranging from traditional instruments to karaoke renditions of ""My Way"" – creating a sensory experience that feels both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant.

""Grand Tour"" exemplifies cinema's unique capacity to transcend boundaries – between past and present, comedy and tragedy, East and West, artifice and authenticity. Like the best travel experiences, it doesn't merely show us new vistas but transforms our perspective. We emerge from this grand journey carrying not just postcard memories but a deeper understanding of human connection across the seemingly insurmountable distances of time, culture, and the heart.",9.0
1232781,Sterben,"This features a collection of stories featuring the members of the “Lunies” family. Father “Gerdi” (Hans-Uwe Bauer) is suffering the near terminal effects of Parkinson’s and lives with his wife “Lissy” (Corinna Harfouch) who isn’t really faring all that much better. Their son “Tom” (Lars Eidinger) is a composer working in an emotionally charged environment with his lifelong friend and composer “Bernard” (Robert Gwisdek) who has recently completed a piece called “Dying”; whilst his sister “Ellen” (Lilith Stangenberg) lives a life as a dental assistant peppered with a great deal of booze and some random sex, increasingly with her married colleague “Sebastian” (Ronald Vogel). The family are fairly disjointed, and when the father dies we see how they reconcile with home truths abounding, the failings of electric cars made pretty clear and the virtues of forest funerals advertised too! There is a considerable degree of energy from both siblings here. Eidinger’s side of the coin involves a torrid relationship with his mother and delivers one of the most entertainingly frank conversations you’re ever likely to see, all while he is caught up in a love triangle with his ex-girlfriend and her newborn baby and the baby’s father whom she would rather he was than “Moritz” (Nico Holonics). “Ellen”, well she’s a bit of a firebrand and let’s also say that if you are at all squeamish about dentists, drills, masks and… well, just suffice to say that there are some scenes that really did make me very grateful I was the only person at this screening! You wouldn’t want to take her to a concert neither! There is lots of humour here, but it’s not comedy nor is it laugh out loud. It’s much more scenario and character-based and the strong performances cleverly interweave the strands towards the ending in a fashion that guarantees that an happy ending is the last thing we can expect. It is a long film, but it is structured in a way that keeps it engaging, touching, at times quite sad and at times realistically poignant as family life is put under a microscope. We are also treated to quite an orchestral treat at the end, too, as this maelstrom of human emotions moves on to new chapters. ",7.0
1143508,You Gotta Believe,"In the recently released 2024 film ""You Gotta Believe,"" Luke Wilson takes on the lead role in a faith-based baseball movie that falls short of expectations. The title misleads viewers into thinking it's a feel-good underdog sports story, but instead, it veers into unnecessary comedy that detracts from the emotional depth it aims to achieve.

Wilson's casting as the lead feels out of place, his comedic nature overpowering any attempts at drama. The rushed plot fails to properly develop the characters or storyline, leaving the audience disconnected from the narrative. The lack of originality in casting and character development further hampers the film's impact, with forgettable performances across the board.

The film's attempt at incorporating faith-based elements feels forced and lacks sincerity, with a brief moment of spiritual reflection overshadowed by the overall tone of the movie. Inconsistencies, such as Wilson's character failing to realistically portray his battle with cancer, further highlight the film's shortcomings.

Overall, ""You Gotta Believe"" struggles to find its footing, wavering between genres and failing to deliver a cohesive and compelling story. With its poorly executed writing and lackluster performances, the film ultimately falls short of being a memorable or meaningful viewing experience.",1.0

808482,The People's Joker,"Wow – what can one say about this wild, woolly, wigged-out spoof of superhero movies in which the protagonist is an edgy, crusading transgender harlequin comedian fighting the power structure of a corrupt, narrow-minded society? That description alone is pretty wacky in itself, but, as the finished product shows, its depiction on screen is even more bizarre and outrageous. Writer-actor-director Vera Drew’s debut feature is simultaneously an exercise in the outlandish that’s part high camp, part in-your-face irreverence, part alternative sexuality manifesto and part love letter to the Batman mythology turned on its ear. This story of a small-town boy’s transgender awakening as a springboard to finding a new life in the wilds of Gotham City’s underground comedy scene tells an off-the-wall, often-frenetically paced, sometimes-sentimental tale that defies conventional classification. Its inventive mix of live action, motion capture photography and animation serves up a unique viewing experience unlike anything most audiences have ever seen, including among most seasoned cinephiles. It also delivers some positively scathing one-liners and wicked sight gags that will leave many thinking “I can’t believe they just did that!” Collectively, it makes for the kind of picture that will likely earn this production cult movie status and a guaranteed spot on midnight show movie lineups. Despite its many inspired cinematic innovations, however, the narrative occasionally tends toward overzealous self-indulgence and cryptic ideologies that appear to be employed simply to carry the story forward, making for a production that seems to be trying too hard just to see how much of a stunned reaction it can get from the audience. It has also come under some scrutiny for pushing the limits of fair use issues and acceptable propriety boundaries, elements that raised the eyebrows of some critics and of those who created the source materials from which this work draws (but that have also subsequently added to the picture’s undeniable allure). Nevertheless, if you’re looking for something that’s part DC Comics, part John Waters, part “Liquid Sky” (1982), part “Rocky Horror Picture Show” (1975), and part exploration of the unknown and untried, this one might be right up your alley. But, if you’re put off by such an eclectic blend of satire, social commentary, visual imagery and heretical rumination, don’t say you weren’t warned.",6.0
1208284,Zwei zu Eins,"Stories based on the notion that “truth is stranger than fiction” often provide a great foundation for comedy, and writer-director Natja Brunckhorst’s second feature is evidence of that. This fact-based tale set in 1990 during the transitionary days of German reunification follows the newly uncertain lives of a group of working class residents in the city of Halberstadt as they seek to cope with the emerging social, economic and political paradigm that has been thrust upon them. As their East German homeland is absorbed into its Western counterpart, the socialist nation begins evolving into a new capitalist enclave. But this process is fraught with serious fiscal consequences with hard-hitting impact on East Germany’s citizens, many of whom now find themselves without work and a source of income, prospects that are likely to persist for at least a year, if not longer. And, unless they swap their soon-to-be-worthless East German currency for Deutsch Marks by a fast-approaching deadline, they’ll be without savings and working capital, too. So, in the face of these pressing circumstances, it’s truly ironic that a quartet of financially strapped locals should stumble into a huge stash of East German money that’s been casually disposed of in an underground (and surprisingly easily accessible) bunker, left to decay – and available for the taking. They impulsively grab as much as they can carry, but they’re nevertheless left with the question of what to do with it in the face of the impending exchange deadline. The answer lies in a creative money laundering scheme cleverly cooked up with a host of similarly situated community residents who seek to not only trade in the newly acquired cash without drawing undue attention, but also to expand upon the legitimately scrubbed reserves to build an even larger mutually held nest-egg. Doing so has its share of challenges, though, both economically and personally, yielding more than its share of surprises, conflicts and hearty belly laughs. While the film is a little slow to get started and has a few moments that either could have been eliminated or executed more deftly, “Two to One” otherwise delivers on all fronts. The picture’s fine ensemble cast, crisp writing, catchy soundtrack and spot-on period piece production values mesh well, spinning an inspiring, touching and humorous underdog yarn about hard-pressed everyday folks rising up to address extraordinary circumstances. It’s also a feel good, family-oriented tale told in an unlikely setting under unlikely conditions that are probably little known to those outside of Germany, but one that effectively proves once again that the truth really is often stranger than fiction.",8.0

How to rescue themselves, their fellow miners, ""Sparky"", ""Nick"" and still find uncle ""Niall"" - well that's the fun part in this quickly paced and engaging big-eyed animation. It combines the intrepidness of the pioneering spirit with some good old fashioned wild west adventure scenarios and provides us with a little bit of ""Temple of Doom"" (1984) into the bargain.

Niclas Larsson adapts the source material with a mix of dark humor, ambiguity, and symbolism, creating a narrative that's as surreal as it's thought-provoking.

1009679,Hard Miles,"Matthew Modine is quite effective here as the cycling-obsessed Doug Townsend. By day, he's a sort of hybrid between a prison officer and social worker for young men in various stages of the criminal justice system. He is about to go on two week trip cycling the 700-odd miles to the Grand Canyon but their facility is under constant funding threat and they need something that will make a ""splash"". He leads a welding class of four disparate lads who each have their own problems and who could pick a fight with Mother Theresa! Then he hits on an idea to get them to make their own bikes. His boss and his colleague ""Haddie"" (Cynthia Kaye McWilliams) are somewhat sceptical of his next suggestion. He takes them all along on his trip. She had already been involved in a disabling altercation at work, so could drive the supply van whilst the rest cycle. It's risky. They aren't so fit, they might abscond and presently, would cheerily ride over each other before going anywhere! From here on, it's all rather predicable but the underlying messages of inter-reliance, team spirit and friendship evolve quite well with strong contributions from Jahking Guillory - the recalcitrant ""Woolbright"" and from Jackson Kelly as the weedy ""Smink"" who has significant dietary issue: he doesn't eat. The photography works well on two levels. The scenery as we travel towards the Canyon itself, and the intensive style of coverage of their journey involving us in the strenuousness of their struggle both physically and emotionally. It's essentially about having purpose, I think. Rudderless people who are abandoned to drift along aimlessly fall into bad habits. Townsend sees that and wants to head off their loneliness and sense of hopelessness at the pass by giving them something to be proud of. To achieve on their own terms. It's a bit long but has some comedy (frequently from or at the expense of McWilliams) and even if the conclusion is pretty obvious from the get-go, it's still a film that has some punch at the end.",7.0

1249385,Ghost Game,"There are bad horror movies, and then there’s Ghost Game — a film so bafflingly misguided, it feels like it was written by someone who skimmed a BuzzFeed list called “Spooky Stuff 101” and then said, “Yeah, that'll do.” Released in 2024 and on track to become a sleep aid for horror fans everywhere for years to come, this film squanders a halfway-decent premise with the grace of a haunted turnip rolling downhill.

The setup? A couple of influencers take part in the world’s dumbest internet challenge, sneaking into strangers’ homes and trying to convince them their houses are haunted — all while recording it for views. And their next stop? A mansion with a tragic, spooky past. Original? Not even a little. But fine, horror loves a haunted house. The real crime here is what follows: a tangled mess of half-baked subplots, including a shadowy figure running the ""Ghost Game"" network, a traumatized family, and an ancient curse (maybe?). None of these threads go anywhere interesting — they just sort of hang there like cobwebs nobody bothered to clean up.

The cast mostly sleepwalks through the script like they’re unsure if this is a horror movie or a high school drama club experiment. Zaen Haidar, as the boyfriend, delivers lines like he's trying to remember if he left the oven on. The supporting cast ranges from forgettable to straight-up confused. But amid the chaos, Kia Dorsey actually shows up to work. She plays Laura like she’s in a completely different, much better movie — one with actual stakes and character development. Dorsey gives us tension, conflict, and actual expressions with her face, which is more than can be said for everyone else wandering around like Sims waiting for their next command.

But let’s not let the script off the hook. Oh no. The dialogue is an all-you-can-eat buffet of nonsense. Lines like “The darkness feeds the fame and the fame feeds the fear” make you wonder if the screenwriter was just typing random emo lyrics into Final Draft while listening ""bangers"" from Brave Little Abacus. None of the ideas — the game, the ghosts, the evil puppet master — are ever fleshed out. It’s as if the film kept introducing plot points and then immediately forgot about them, like a grandparent who keeps calling you by your cousins name (it happens to the best of us).

Visually, Ghost Game tries really hard to look spooky, with dim lighting and a color palette best described as “nicotine-stained wallpaper.” Instead of crafting atmosphere, it just feels like someone smeared used motor oil on the lens and said, “That’s art.” Every jump scare is predictable, every twist is telegraphed five scenes too early, and the ending tries so hard to be deep, it loops back around to being unintentionally hilarious -- like watching a friend, cheeks gripped run to the restroom after sharting.

In short, Ghost Game is a masterclass in how to waste money. It had a premise ripe for commentary on internet fame and horror culture, but instead it gave us a jumble of clichés held together with duck tape and ghost emojis.

1199974,Párvulos: Hijos del Apocalipsis,"It takes real talent for a filmmaker to successfully combine elements from several different genres in one picture and make the finished product work, but that’s precisely what Mexican writer-director Issac Ezban has done in his latest offering. This post-Apocalyptic sci-fi saga fuses elements of classic horror, smart horror, high camp and zombie tales into an entertaining guilty pleasure that features moments of frightfulness and comedy, as well as heartwarming nods to tender family togetherness (albeit not in the most typical sense). In a world where things have fallen apart due to the effects of an inadequately tested vaccine used in treating the virus behind a global pandemic (a timely touch), those who have managed to stay unaffected have taken refuge in remote hideaways, trying to stave off the diseased monsters that now roam the landscape. Such is the case with three brothers (Mateo Ortega Casillas, Leonardo Cervantes, Farid Escalante Correa) who have holed up in a remote forest house that they found in their wanderings. But, despite their ardent efforts to survive, there are still monsters all about, including in the basement of their new home. “Párvulos” is thus their challenge-ridden tale to stay alive, one filled with terror, as well as unexpected laughs (including a music video parody montage) and a host of strangers who cross their paths, making everyday life perpetually interesting. The story is effectively brought to life with fine performances by the three young actors and inventive cinematography featuring an intriguing palette of black-and-white images tinged with bleak red and green accents, a suitable color scheme befitting the nature of the film and its setting. The use of red, of course, is integral to the ample blood and guts on display here, so sensitive viewers may want to take heed, although such gratuitousness is wholly appropriate for the tenor of the narrative, often enhancing the campy aspects of this story. Perhaps my only issue with this release is that its script sometimes meanders somewhat more than I’d like, with certain plot developments seemingly emerging out of left field – not that they’re ill-conceived, but their appearance feels a little more happenstance than expected. Still in all, this multi-genre offering is a ghoulishly fun romp with a macabre sense of humor, good scares and a few surprisingly heart-tugging moments. And, with a combination of qualities like that, what more could anyone ask for?",7.0
1080252,Майор Гром: Игра,"Major Grom: The Game feels cluttered. This film tries to do too much, getting so tangled up in its varied story elements and exposition, it looses any clear sense of direction. The results a rather busy, somewhat frustrating watch there never really goes anywhere terribly interesting, with a thoroughly anti-climatic ending.

Its a shame too, as there are some good ideas on show, acting and action is polished and CGI top notch. 

In summary, had the script taken a cleaner, simple approach, setting limits on the diverse aspects of this story, then this could have worked extremely well. As it stands it feels cluttered and anti climatic. Suffice to say, a
rather mediocre watch.",5.0

The pace of this film is glacially slow, very much at odd's with what should be a fast paced action film. Any action that does take place is minimal and crammed into the later half of the film. 

Worse still, character development feels stunted, so its not as if, there's much in the way of a human interest story to compensate for the lack of exposition. 

In summary, in my estimation, a promising idea, let down by a mostly lackadaisical script and handling. A pass from me.",4.0
988397,Une langue universelle,"Philosophers and metaphysicians are generally quick to agree that we’re all fundamentally connected, both to one another and to everything around us, that there’s a certain universality binding all there is in our existence. But how many of us actually take the time to truly recognize, consider and appreciate this? Maybe this calls for stepping away from our everyday world and immersing ourselves in some sort of alternate version of it to see the inherent connections and the value that lie therein. That’s what writer-actor-director Matthew Rankin so eloquently shows us in his second feature outing, an absurdist fable of seemingly unrelated stories that ultimately tie together to illustrate the bonds that unite us and how we can put them to best use for our collective benefit. This triptych of tall tales tells the stories of a Quebec government worker (Rankin) who quits his job to return home to visit his long-estranged mother in Winnipeg; a part-time tour guide (Pirouz Nemati) who leads small bands of visitors on an excursion of mundane, unimpressive alleged tourist sites in Manitoba’s capital city; and a pair of concerned grade school classmates (Rojina Esmaeili, Saba Vahedyousefi) who try to secure funds to help a friend (Sobhan Javadi) replace his lost eye glasses when they fall off and are quickly pilfered by a crafty. free-roaming wild turkey. The assistance these individuals freely offer to others (and receive from them in kind) to get through the quirky challenges of these bizarre circumstances, in turn, reveals the unspoken “universal language” that binds all of us – our mutual compassion and support for one another, particularly those in need. All of this is set against the backdrop of an alternate version of Canada (where the primary language is Farsi) in winter, providing a fitting setting for wending our way through the cold world that surrounds us. “Universal Language” thus serves up a heartwarming, gentle yet insightful story that reminds us of our innate linkage and the goodwill that we’re all capable of unselfishly extending to one another when warranted, something that, ideally, should come to us as second nature, as it does for the characters in this film. And all of this is nestled into a wealth of hilarious, off-the-wall humor, coming across like a mixture of Monty Python and Federico Fellini. Admittedly, the film’s opening act may seem somewhat disjointed and perhaps even a bit too idiosyncratic for its own good at times, but these issues gradually dissipate as the picture plays out and the pieces of its various story threads begin piecing themselves together, revealing the aforementioned intrinsic connections among us. This delightful indie gem has largely flown below the radar thus far, despite its awards, nominations and rave reception at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, as well as its designation as one of the National Board of Review’s Top 5 International Films of last year. Indeed, at a time when it seems like there’s so much dividing us, it’s gratifying to see a release like this, one that tenderly spotlights more of what binds us than what sets us apart.",8.0
1277296,The Girl in the Pool,"""... Tom's eventual journey towards something resembling redemption is played a little too straight. One final bad decision to cap off a film full of bad decisions should be laced with dramatic irony, especially since it is a damning indictment of how white men's rage, at any age, is often coddled and protected by those with the most power. It's a stinger that would have been better served on a more preposterously pulpy platter. Instead, the film ends with a limp whimper. What could have been a deliciously dark satire, instead remains in the liminal space known as aggressively average. — [**Source**](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-girl-in-the-pool-movie-review-2024)

1276031,Witches,"Witches(2024): A Searing Examination of Medical Gaslighting and Women's Silenced Narratives

Elizabeth Sankey's documentary ""Witches"" is not just a film about historical persecution. It's a scathing indictment of how society systematically dismisses women's experiences, particularly in medical contexts.

Using a brilliant collage of film clips and intimate personal testimonies, Sankey traces the horrifying continuum from medieval witch hunts to contemporary medical gaslighting. The film powerfully demonstrates how women's pain - especially around reproductive health - has been consistently minimized, misunderstood, and mythologized.

The documentary's focus on postpartum psychosis reveals a stark truth: women's mental health experiences are still treated as aberrant, mysterious, even supernatural. By juxtaposing historical witch trials with modern medical practices, Sankey exposes a chilling constant: women are rarely believed about their own bodies.

This systemic dismissal isn't abstract. It's deadly. Pharmaceutical research has historically excluded women, heart attack symptoms are still primarily understood through male physiological models, and conditions like endometriosis take an average of eight years to diagnose - primarily because women's pain is not taken seriously.

""Witches"" is more than a documentary. It's a necessary confrontation with how institutional misogyny operates, how it silences, and how it continues to harm.",10.0
1242397,The Truth vs. Alex Jones,"It’s one thing to question authority and official explanations of highly public events; it’s something else entirely to portray them in a wholly falsified light, especially when done so in a ridiculing manner that causes tremendous personal pain. Such is what happened when conspiracy theorist broadcaster Alex Jones fanatically contended that the December 2012 mass shooting at Connecticut’s Sandy Hook Elementary School was a staged false flag event aimed at prompting the seizure of the private citizens’ firearms, essentially gutting the guarantees of the Second Amendment. Jones vociferously claimed that the event didn’t happen as reported in the mainstream media, that it was all pulled off with actors and that no one was killed. He openly mocked the public grieving of devastated parents through a relentless campaign of blatant disinformation, effectively enabling him to convince nearly a quarter of the nation’s population into believing his story. Finally, after many anguishing years (including unbridled derision, public ridicule and death threats from disbelieving fanatics and hecklers), those who lost loved ones fought back, filing defamation suits in Jones’s home state of Texas and in Connecticut, site of the tragedy. Documentarian Dan Reed’s latest feature chronicles the events of this troubling story with no-holds-barred candor, capturing the searing pain of the Sandy Hook families, Jones’s cartoonish out-of-control bluster and extensive courtroom footage of the two trials. Shot over four years, the filmmaker effectively captures the crazed ravings of a two-faced, delirious conman whose self-serving self-promotion efforts made P.T. Barnum look like a rank amateur by comparison. But what’s perhaps most unsettling here is the film’s uncompromising depiction of someone who honestly believed he could publicly say whatever he wanted through today’s powerful, far-reaching communications technology – regardless of its truthfulness – and get away with it, a truly potent cautionary tale for our times. “The Truth vs. Alex Jones” poignantly reminds us of the precious nature of freedom of speech and the need to protect it, especially where matters of responsibility are concerned. Indeed, the First Amendment may allow us to express ourselves, but it doesn’t give us license to lie.",8.0

1163186,We Grown Now,"No one ever said growing up was easy. It’s inherently a time for a lot of hard lessons, but they’re the kind of teachings that we need to help prepare us for adulthood. And, depending on the circumstances, it can be particularly challenging but also rewarding at the same time. Such is the experience of two young boys, Malik (Blake Cameron James) and Eric (Gian Knight Ramirez), best friends who go through virtually everything together in Chicago’s notorious Cabrini-Green Housing Project in 1992, a time when it was just about at its worst. Writer-director Minhal Baig’s third feature outing is an intimate, sensitive yet gripping depiction of childhood under difficult circumstances but laced with hopeful aspirations for being able to become whatever we dream about. This nominee for three 2023 Independent Spirit Awards, including best feature, is just about perfect in every regard, from its gorgeous cinematography and expert film editing to its fine original score and the performances of its superb ensemble cast, particularly the young protagonists, who come off completely naturally and effectively. What’s more, “We Grown Now” deftly and simultaneously manages to show the Windy City at both its best and its worst, no small feat, to be sure. In addition. there’s almost nothing in the narrative of this film that we all can’t relate to in one way or another, even if we didn’t grow up under the same conditions as those experienced by the characters in this film. It will touch you deeply and certainly move you – possibly to tears at some point – but this is a worthwhile release that absolutely should not be missed.",10.0
1171296,Baltimore,"Compelled to be presented to the Queen as a debutante in return for an Oxford University education, Rose Dugdale (Imogen Poots) rebels from a fairly early age. Her privileged upbringing - as so often happens - leads her to detest the very hands that fed her in her childhood. Meantime, the troubles in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s are only increasing and after a trip to a training camp in Cuba, she returns a fully capable, bomb-making, terrorist - with a brain and a conscience. A plot is devised to rob a stately home of some valuable Goya, Rubens and Vermeer paintings and hold them as hostage for £500,000 and the freedom of two hunger striking IRA prisoners incarcerated in the UK. What now ensues is a rather weekly constructed speculation as to just how this shrewd plan was executed and of the aftermath. The story is an interesting history - but with the timelines dancing around all over the place and the performance of Poots a bit hit or miss, I found the pace of the film too bitty. We are all too often left dangling when a storyline is being developed and talking of development, there is very little to inform us about who the real Dugdale was. The screenplay doesn't shy away from describing the radicalisation here nor of some of it's concomitant brutality but somehow her vitriolic detestation of the British state is left completely unexplained. This subject could make for a strong political documentary on a woman who was clearly dedicated to her cause, but as a drama - this doesn't ever really engage.",6.0
706693,Timestalker,"Alice Lowe’s Timestalker initially grabbed my attention with its promising premise—especially since I had really enjoyed her previous film, Prevenge. The quirky and darkly comic style Lowe brought to that project had me expecting another sharp, unique movie here. Unfortunately, despite its inventive concept, Timestalker ran out of steam much earlier than I hoped.

The idea of a time-travelling love obsession spanning centuries should offer a lot of comedic material. Still, the film quickly exhausts its best jokes, leaving a narrative that lacks momentum. While there are some fun moments early on, and Lowe’s distinctive style is clear, the pacing feels uneven, and much of the humour doesn’t sustain itself throughout the film. I wanted to love this as much as Prevenge, but Timestalker didn’t quite deliver on its potential.",4.0
706693,Timestalker,"Alice Lowe did virtually everything in this quirky drama about the immortal ""Agnes"" who travels through time desperate to reunite with an highwayman (Aneurin Bernard) who robbed her sometime in the 17th century. Snag is - every time she manages to engineer a scenario when they can be together, she ends up dead! We reset, and moving steadily through time we encounter her in different guises and him likewise evolving, ultimately into a jaded rock star. Along the way, she is guided by the omnipresent ""Scipio"" (Jacob Anderson) who plays a role similar to one of Shakespeare's fools, by her maid/best pal ""Meg"" (Tanya Reynolds) and slightly bonkers husband (Nick Frost) as loads of daft adventures ensue. It's a sort of hybrid of Peter Greenaway meets Terry Gilliam this, with shades of ""Monty Python"" as the humour has a slapstick goriness to it that starts off quite funny but all too quickly runs out of steam. Indeed, this really is the problem with this, It's more of a short story that's been drawn out to fill ninety minutes. Once the point has been made and the joke established, it seems content just to shift the timeline and then tell us a similar story all over again. I did like the premiss, and there's no doubt that Lowe does have some good comedy timing at the start as her hate-hate rapport with her rakish husband is demonstrated, but Bernard was always more about his smile than his skill and sadly the whole thing just faded away. Zach Wyatt is quite entertaining as the dubious tarot reader but in the end it's too close to a rather weak farce for me.",6.0
1011516,The Present,"A cinema release without any prior reviews on a few major websites?! How about that!

I gotta say, <em>'The Present'</em> surprised me big time! The lack of awareness that I had for it prior to watching (to be expected based on the earlier mentioned, evidently), a bog-standard poster and a meh-sounding premise meant that I wasn't expecting much from this 2024 flick. However, I had a seriously good time viewing it!

It's, in my opinion, a well crafted movie and, unexpectedly, quite amusing, it is also extremely touching when all is said and done. Isla Fisher and Greg Kinnear make for a solid onscreen pairing, while the trio of youngsters in Shay Rudolph, Easton Rocket Sweda and Mason Shea Joyce - even if the latter has less to work with - all give good performances.

1011516,The Present,"There's something quite engaging about Easton Rocket Sweda's ""Taylor"" character in this quite enjoyable and fast-moving family fantasy. He is a young man who loathes being touched and who communicates via an audio-board or by using an Etch-a-Sketch. Indulged? Well that was my first thought, then we meet the family and maybe the kid has the right idea. Anyway, his grandfather's bust old clock arrives and it's put in his basement where he tinkers around with it and gets it, somewhat miraculously, to work. His parents (solid efforts from Isla Blair and Greg Kinnear) have summonsed the family to a dinner that evening to announce their trial separation, but ""Taylor"" has discovered that the now repaired timepiece allows him to manipulate time - within a twenty four hour period. He reckons that he can change the circumstances of his mum and dad's struggling marriage - but every time he thinks he's on the cusp of averting familial disaster, well we are soon back to square one. He decides to enlist the help of his loved-up sister ""Emma"" (Shay Rudolph) the then finally their brother ""Max"" (Mason Shea Joyce - wasn't he in ""McFly""?). The more they meddle, though, the messier things get as the grown ups all lurch from one near miss to an other. Old Father Time is starting to get a bit bored with the repetitive nature of this story (not just him) and when the kids realise that they can't keep doing this indefinitely, things have to come to an head. It works quite well for about an hour with quite a quirky storyline and the five main characters having some fun with almonds, a shiny red sports car and some fake snow but thereafter the story starts to recycle itself once too often as we head to what was always a fairly predictable conclusion. It's an easy film to watch, but not one you will remember and probably not one that needs to be seen in a cinema.",6.0

996087,Hoard,"The young ""Maria"" (Lily-Beau Leach) lives with her loving mum (Hayley Squires) in an home full to the brim of junk. Some of it just bric-a-brac, some of it more distasteful and unhealthy, but the pair rub along well enough scavenging their way through skips and bins. ""Maria"" has a tough time at school and doesn't really fit in, so when an accident at home sees her put into foster care, she has quite a bit of adjusting to do under the care of the savvy ""Michelle"" (Samantha Spiro). Now we scoot forward to her late teens where she (now Saura Lightfoot-Leon) is still living with ""Michelle"" and seemingly quite a content. One morning it's announced that ""Michael"" (Joseph Quinn), who was a former charge, is coming to stay for a while whilst his housing is sorted out. He's a decent cove with a girlfriend expecting a baby. Almost immediately he arrives, the two click. Not quite in any conventional sense, but there does seem to be something between them, and understanding. It's this that starts ""Maria"" thinking of her past, pining for it even - especially when a delivery man presents her with something entirely unexpected in a small package! With the two of them living increasingly closely, how might their relationship develop? Now this isn't for the squeamish. Right from the start we experience the rather sticky downsides of their quite grubby way of life, and as the story moves to it's second phase it becomes a potent, if shallow, character study of two people that just don't conform. The problem for me here is that the drama goes nowhere. It's a sequence of observations of the life of a woman that I didn't feel I knew on any level at all. Her behaviour is unsettling but it seemed to me that was so that the audience could feel unsettled, squirm in our chairs a bit, rather than because the character of ""Maria"" was evolving in any way. Indeed she seems to retrogress as the film just becomes increasingly tasteless and contrived. It's rare to see people leave an arthouse cinema mid-film, but they did during this. I didn't, but I am not at all sure what the point was, or to whom this is aimed. It has it's moments and at times is really visceral, but sorry - by the end I found it all just a bit too introspective and dull.",6.0

Thing is, though, his new blue friend needs life energy to survive, and so they have to find a way to repatriate him with his own kind on the moon else a catastrophe will befall all of us! There's only one way to do that, and that's to find ""Max"" - an ostracised wolf who lives deep in the forest and who possesses the magic spell required. Off they go on their search, but will the grudge-bearing ""Max"" even want to help them or might she have her own cunning plan to avenge herself on those who cast her out? It's quite a fun family adventure this but it does struggle to find it's audience. The very young probably won't appreciate the sense of (tea time) menace, especially towards the end - and those a bit older will probably be put off by the initially rather childish characterisation of ""Freddy"". It's also probably twenty minutes too long, but as a simple light-hearted drama it does what it says on the tin, touching of the aspirations of all of us when we are young and wanting to fit in, to lead and be valued.

For the next eighty minutes or so, we follow their adventure as they take to the water and to the skies, appreciate some of the greatest natural phenomena, and probably most importantly - they have fun as a family who all know that things will soon be much less enjoyable and care-free. The parents - Édith Lemay and Sébastian Pelletier carry out quite a juggling act as they strive to create an ordinary, unexceptional environment for their youngsters whilst always conscious of what travails are yet to come. Clearly, money doesn't seem to be an issue here, and so Mia, Léo, Colin and Laurent can embark on their travelogue enthusiastically - and at times that zeal for life and for each other proves a powerful fillip for all, including us. The photography is artfully delivered showcasing some of the astonishing features that grace this world, and the conversation is restricted to snippets of chat rather than any more formal narration, and I thought that worked well - even if, at times, I felt a little like an eavesdropper. Obviously not everyone has the resources to react to an upcoming trauma as these people did, but it's not really the scale of their Phileas Fogg-ness that stands out, it's the fact that as a family, and a largely aware one at that, they manage to navigate their trip - tantrums and all - in a fashion that provides hope for a future that will be different, but will also be peppered with memories they will never forget and that will be built on pretty solid familial foundations.",7.0

His jokes were consistently hilarious, keeping me entertained from start to finish without making me feel out of the loop or clueless.

Rife's stage presence is truly remarkable, and his energy is infectious. I once considered seeing him perform live, but the steep ticket prices proved to be a barrier.

Yugo Sakamoto is fucking insane, and i can't really decide if im jealous of his dedication and work or to idolize him.

The guy is just 28 YEARS OLD. It's truly insane how good this guy is and words alone do not give justice to this man's skill. Constant fucking improvement is seen in every sequel, and the films have a clear overarching narrative that satisfyingly culminates all it's built up themes into one epic final film. Madness.

Kensuke Sonomura is another obvious praise here. Like Yugo, the man continuously innovates and improves his action setpieces with his awesome full uncooperative madness, and his ability to combine usual movie fight finesse with grounded streams of consciousness.

Izawa and Takaishi also deserve heavy praise. With Izawa going from pure stunt person to now full fledged actor, and Takaishi went from being an actor with no stunt experience, to heavily involving herself in the action, and now even starring in a lead role in Sonomura's Ghost Killer.

The social commentary is also still very much prevalent here, now highlighted with Sosuke Ikematsu's Kaede Fuyumura, who represents the grind mindset. A perfectionist hitman who constantly beats himself up over minor mistakes and not caring for the actual result and the satisfaction of the client.

Sosuke as an action actor also shows insane improvement here. From struggling to do a roundhouse kick in Shin Kamen Rider, to now looking like a fucking killer in his fights. (His first fight with Saori Izawa is one of the best fight scenes i have ever seen)

His comedy is also severely underrated, with his comedic scenes acting as great relief to all his killing acts, showing that he is indeed still human.

Kaede also pairs well with Iruka, who acts as a midpoint between Mahiro and Kaede's work/gig lives. With Mahiro having friendship, Kaede having nothing but his work, and Mahiro who wants to have friendship, but hides in a mask to be mysterious, ""cool"" and more efficent in work. Shoutout as well to the brilliance of Iruka's apology scene which basically summarized the entirety of Baby Assasins 1.

All in all the movie is just fucking pure cinematic madness. And it's all capped with an amazing final fight that finishes and showcases the 3 main character's story arcs and personalities, and fully contextualizing all the built up themes and concepts through movement, violence, and action. From Chisato finally realizing the importance of her friendship with Mahiro, Mahiro's constant improvement in her fights. and Kaede choosing work over life.",10.0

1197662,A Sudden Case of Christmas,"It loses steam as it goes on, though <em>'A Sudden Case of Christmas'</em> is fairly good.

The cast are the big draw. Danny DeVito is obviously the main man, I always enjoy watching him. The likes of Andie MacDowell and Lucy DeVito are alright alongside the aforementioned, though it's Antonella Rose that is the star overall - a strong performance from the youngster. Adrian Dunbar has a small but memorable role, even if he is too good an actor for such a bit part.

It's not the most Christmassy of movies, despite the title. That's to be expected given how the story unfolds in fairness, but definitely something to be aware of if you're planning to watch this for the first time as part of your core festive viewing. It was released at Xmas time, but honestly a summer release would've been more fitting; à la the plot.

What's there, though, is perfectly watchable and the Italian surroundings look grand, at least. It only lasts for around 90 minutes, I admittedly did feel it drag a bit towards the end. More meat on the bones would've helped, the finale could've been something more interesting than what we get with the four-legged fella.

1081680,Jackdaw,"There is a lot to like about indie action thriller “Jackdaw,” from its bold visuals, strong lead performance, and inventive action scenes. The bones for a wickedly successful film are there, but writer/director Jamie Childs can’t quite get a hand on the character development and related emotional weight that’s so desperately needed. It takes such a long time to get going that I was disengaged before the movie even hit the 20 minute mark. That’s why the movie feels as though it’s designed to keep viewers at a distance, which is its downfall.

Set in coastal England over the course of a single night, former motocross champion and Army veteran Jack Dawson (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) returns to his hometown to care for his brother Simon (Leon Harrop) after their mother dies. Jack wants to start a new life and provide for his sibling, so he jumps at the chance to take a job for Silas (Joe Blakemore), an old friend who is now a criminal. The simple task of picking up a mysterious package becomes a total nightmare after Jack is betrayed and Simon is kidnapped. This leads the man to a violence-fueled nocturnal odyssey as he searches for answers and fights to survive.

There’s very little plot to speak of, and the sparse story line really shows. There is a lot of repetitive filler, especially with the multiple scenes of characters at raves, and the story takes a long time to get going. The action sequences fare better, with entertaining and creative fights. The inclusion of everything from jet skis, horses, motorcycles, and boats make this feel like a chapter out of a male extreme dream. The problem is, none of this ever develops into any meaningful care or attachment to the characters.

Jackson-Cohen has a terrific leading man quality, and he is appealing as the flawed, emotional Jack. He completely sells the action scenes too, which is no small feat. Maybe this is because Childs often confuses too-rapid pacing with excitement, because at times the action is hurled at the audience way too rapidly. He also has an awful tendency to overuse shaky cam (which is never, ever a pleasant experience for the viewer). The movie is visually appealing and Childs’ direction is skilled, if flawed.

If you’re into indie thrillers, “Jackdaw” may be one that’s worth checking out simply for the action. I found no emotional investment in the story or characters, so it just didn’t work for me.

1081680,Jackdaw,"Not wishing to start rumours, but if Oliver Jackson-Cohen and Jenna Coleman were ever to have child, it would be a thing of beauty! It may not, however, be terribly discerning as this film is nobody's finest hour. OJC is the eponymous character. A former moto-cross champion with a bit of baggage, he is reduced to intercepting packages strapped to wind turbines in the North Sea for his slightly bonkers dealer pal ""Silas"" (Joe Blakemore). Something's gone wrong with his latest mission though. There's no payday awaiting him at the rendezvous point, then he gets shot at by a man on a horse! Luckily his ageing bike has more HP that the real thing so he escapes only to run out of petrol, then thump a cop who tries to apprehend him, then end up calling in some favours to try and find who has kidnapped his brother ""Simon"" in apparent retaliation for him not delivering the goods. Still with me? ""Jack Dawson"" (yep, there are a few ""Titanic"" jokes) has now to try and fathom who has his sibling and en route we encounter some unsavoury types from England's North East before a frankly rather underwhelming denouement. Coleman features unremarkably once or twice, as does the quite engaging Thomas Turgoose as the outwardly weedy but surprisingly resilient ""Craig"" but the writing is all a bit bland, the story a bit thin and undercooked and the set-piece scenarios are just too staged - especially the police raid of the rave - to be effective. It's watchable and to be fair it doesn't hang around, but it could just as easily be an episode of ""The Professionals"" and I doubt I'll recall it for long.",6.0
999849,Late Bloomers,"In an age where personal responsibility and accountability have become increasingly hard to come by, it’s comforting to know that it’s never too late to grow up, as evidenced in director Lisa Steen’s debut feature outing. This touching yet insightful comedy-drama tells the story of Louise (Karen Gillan), a 28-year-old Brooklynite seriously in need of getting her act together. When the would-be musician breaks her hip while in a drunken stupor, she undergoes surgery to repair the damaged joint, but, while recovering in the hospital, she’s assigned to a semi-private room with a cantankerous old woman who only speaks Polish, Antonina (Margaret Sophie Stein). Language considerations aside, they get off to a rough start on a variety of fronts. But, before long, Louise comes to understand and appreciate Antonina’s simmering frustration with essentially being treated as though she’s invisible and ends up, quite surprisingly, becoming her caretaker after being released from the hospital. And, through this unlikely relationship, Louise starts to take her own life more seriously, leaving her irresponsibility behind and finally living up to her obligations, most notably reconnecting with her mother, Dorothy (Talia Balsam), who’s in the late stages of early onset Alzheimer’s Disease. Based on this picture, it’s certainly heartening to see that it’s possible for those in need of getting their lives in order can still do so, even with some slip-ups along the way. “Late Bloomers” serves up a charming mix of laughs (many of them unexpected in nature) that are well integrated with its share of tender, sensitive moments, all brought to life by the excellent performances of the two leads and a host of colorful supporting players. There are a few points where the narrative meanders a bit, but these are more than made up for by everything that the filmmaker, cast and crew get right. Based on what I’ve seen here, I’m anxious to see what this director comes up with next, as this effort represents an auspicious start to what I hope and believe will be a promising filmmaking career.",8.0
983524,Birthday Girl,"“Nanna” (Trine Dyrholm) has a strained relationship with her daughter “Cille” (Flora Lindahl) and so invites her and her friend “Lea” (Maja Ida Thiele) onto a Caribbean cruise to celebrate her birthday. The boat duly sets sail and the girls meet “Kevin” (Herman Tammeraas) and his brother “Ryan” (Nathan Popa) and they all let their hair down. A trip out to the boat deck for “Cille” doesn’t not end well, and now distressed, hungover and unable to recall just what did happen, her mother is convinced that she has been raped. She reports her suspicions to the authorities, but with her daughter unwilling to undergo any sort of medical and the ship being in somewhat muddy international waters, they claim their hands are tied and so it falls to “Nanna” to try to identify and shame the culprit. The question is, with “Cille” remaining adamantly uncooperative with her mother, even in private, is she going to get the right man? Too much of this drama is based on the scare factor of the alleged deed and nowhere near enough on developing a characterful story that engages. We are selectively drip-fed information that is manoeuvring us to a series of conclusions that I felt distinctly uncomfortable about. On the one hand we have a “victim” who refuses to incriminate her offender - but is that because there was no offence, or because she doesn’t remember, or because she is ashamed or a bit of all three? Meantime we are encouraged to see one of these young men as a cocky sexual predator without really having any more to go on than a kiss and her mother’s guilt-ridden suspicions. From here on in the scenarios lurch around in a fashion that might be intended to convey the exasperation of “Nanna”, but by presenting an entirely one-sided perspective I actually started to dislike this woman, quite intensely. The denouement is something straight out of Agatha Christie, with an all too convenient wrapping up of events that is every bit as obnoxious as the crime itself. To really get to the heart of depictions of sex crimes like this, you can’t just sail along encouraging the audience to make assumptions about boozed-up responsibility and consent without far more substantial characterisations otherwise it just perpetuates man-hating attitudes that help no one.",6.0
1156646,باي باي طبريا,"Memorializing one’s family history is an exercise that can provide a valuable record of our relatives’ past and establish the legacy that has carried through the years to the present day. It can also teach us much about what distinguishes one’s kindreds in terms of their characteristics, accomplishments and values. The impact of that can be quite revelatory, too, producing a chronicle of inspiring insights and profound achievements of one’s relations, especially those that emerged in the face of challenge, adversity and cultural limitations. In her second documentary feature, director Lina Soualem has sought to capture a loving record of those qualities in this highly personal film that charts the lives of four generations of her family’s women, including herself, her mother (Emmy-nominated actress Hiam Abbass), her grandmother and her great-grandmother. The picture primarily follows the experiences of the filmmaker’s three ancestral generations during their lives in their Palestinian homeland from the days of the creation of Israel in 1948 to the time of Abbass’s emigration to France, where she began her acting career and gave birth to her daughter. In doing so, the film juxtaposes the family’s individual history with that of the larger cultural backdrop against which their story is set. It also provides viewers with a look at the actress’s return to Palestine with her daughter after a prolonged absence, a time of remembrance and reflection. As touching and uplifting as this story can be, however, there are times when it starts to play more like a highly polished home movie than a theatrical documentary. It also would have benefitted from a deeper look at the historical back story and how its events helped shape the lives of these courageously determined women. That’s particularly true in the wake of recent developments (even though this film was made before them), given that the inclusion of such background material would have leant a more profound understanding to the longstanding prevailing circumstances in Palestine and the role that they played in the unfolding of this family’s story. Moreover, the film seems to puzzlingly downplay Abbass’s career accomplishments, achievements that marked a key turning point in the family’s history, one specifically inspired by her yearning to leave the “suffocating” conditions of life in her homeland. Soualem certainly deserves kudos for her attempt to deftly mesh personal and cultural considerations in this film, her heart clearly in the right place. However, the overall mix doesn’t quite gel as well as it could have, leaving viewers with a story that may be moving and poetic but that somehow feels somewhat incomplete. Perhaps that comes from being too close to the material, no matter how sincere one’s intents might be – and how earnestly one wants to see those goals fulfilled.",6.0
1139072,Made in England: The Films of Powell and Pressburger,"Using some rarely seen interview footage of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger and very, very, few industry talking heads, this is a fitting tribute to two men who trail-blazed British cinema in the 1940s and truly inspired the presenter - Martin Scorsese. His pieces to camera are sparingly interspersed into his narration of the astonishingly bold and creative aspiration of these film-makers who made a range of films ranging from lightly comedic romances through the dark times of WWII and their more propagandist elements, to full blown theatrical adaptations using great artistes like Moira Shearer, Robert Helpmann, Robert Sounseville, Ludmilla Tcherina and the usually present Anton Walbrook. In partnership with the additional, often inspired, vision of regular cinematographers like Jack Cardiff and Christopher Challis they used colour, shade, light and most importantly (I think) music to augment some stirring characterisations and potent stories that tackled a plethora of topics that resonated strongly with audiences hitherto unexposed to the sheer grandeur of the experience on the screen before them. The documentary is composed so as to leave virtually all of the heavy lifting to the pair themselves. Scorsese gently, but enthusiastically and insightfully, guides us through their careers without spending much time on their personal lives or other distractions, and that allows us to savour the variety of the Archer's productions, the delicacy of their writing - especially from David Niven, Roger Livesey and Kim Hunter in ""A Matter of Life and Death"" (1946), and leaves us with a sympathetically and critically crafted appraisal of two cinema geniuses. It's a chronology of sorts, but not just of film making - it tells us a little about the evolving attitudes and tastes of the audiences too.",7.0
1058032,Here,"Romanian builder ""Stefan"" (Stefan Gota) is quite adept at making soup! With his holidays looming he is clearing out his fridge and hoping to get his ageing jalopy fixed so he can travel. He is also a bit of an insomniac and wanders the streets at night exploring and cutting a rather lonely figure appearing to have few friends. That is until he is walking along a country path and encounters a lady (Liyo Gong) examining the mosses that grow freely. They have met before - in her aunt's Chinese restaurant, briefly, amidst a thunderstorm and he is intrigued with her scientific endeavours. She explains to him what she is doing and why, informing him that mosses were the first plants ever to grow on the Earth. The next few hours see him diverted from his mission to go collect his car, and for the two to share their afternoon together. Might anything come of it? Well, that's not really the point. Instead, this seems to be a gentle reminder of how much easier, especially when empowered by the power of his vegetable soup, it is for people to engage with easy other or friendly and curious terms. It's a momentary observation of not just human existence, but it also showcases the beauty of nature as it exists amidst our man-made concrete and brick environment. The rain also seems to serve an almost allegorical purpose, wiping the slate clean for another episode in his solitary yet open-minded and friendly life. It is a strangely compelling film to watch. There's no beginning, or end - just a middle, and the two actors deliver plausibly imbuing a certain not easily definable chemistry.",7.0

1305459,里斯本丸沉没,"It is quite interesting that it took over seventy years before anyone tried to discover this wreck, but once it was found nestling in the sand it opened up quite a can of worms as we discovered that it was a freighter carrying two thousand tons of wartime supplies and 1,800 British POWs. These men had been ordered to surrender after the fall of Hong Kong and were being taken to “a beautiful land” where they would be put to hard labour. Except, they didn’t get very far before the ship encountered the USS Grouper that found the 7,000 ton vessel a legitimate target and holed it with one torpedo. The thrust of this documentary takes us through the next 24 hours as the ship slowly sank and the prisoners were treated as little better than malnourished ballast. Filmmaker Fang Li had managed to track down one survivor from the tragedy and as news of his filming spreads, he makes contact with another living in British Columbia and together they provide a poignant insight into just how brutal the regime that detained them was, whilst making it quite obvious that this is not a subject either feel the need to reminisce about. The Geneva Convention - which prohibits the use of POWs as glorified hostages - was simply ignored and the behaviour of their captors as the boat went down is put under quite an horrific spotlight. It’s not just that they were imprisoned; it is that they are left to languish, disease-ridden, in the cargo holds of a ship without food, water, room to move or sleep and even much air to breathe. Worse still, as the vessel gradually disappeared, the survivors in the water were indiscriminately murdered by machine-gun fire. Were it not for the timely and brave intervention of the local Chinese fishing population and their flotilla of sampans and junks, it’s likely that there would have been nobody left to tell of this atrocity. There is virtually no archive to illustrate this with, it’s left to our own imagination; to the descriptions from the two main contributors and to additional input from the relatives of those who died/survived who reference letters and diaries to paint quite a graphically ghastly picture of inhumanity and of gutsy determination. We also hear a little from the family of the American who fired the weapon, and get some sense of the overwhelming feeling of guilt he felt when he later discovered that it wasn’t just the materiel he sent to the depths. It does suffer a little from information overload. There is a lot of text on the screen and I think it might have worked better focussing on fewer families. It might also have benefitted from more engagement with the current Japanese authorities. Perhaps a more full explanation from the Navy or it’s embassy in London as to the extent to which this was policy or just individual zealousness or, of course, both? With no one involved left now, this serves to deliver a salutary reminder of just how cruel mankind can be to each other and of the sacrifices people made for King and country on the other side of the world.",7.0
1285247,Murder Company,"Murder Company is a very basic, moderately watchable, WWII action flick. 

In spite of the presence of Kelsey Grammer, this is very much ""B grade"" material. The bare bones story offers  little lead in or resolution. The narrative and characterisations follow the same, simple trajectory.

That's not to say its not watchable. Taken for what it is, its a fun, exposition driven action romp, that mostly, gets it right (not sure why German ammo crates would have English written on them?...oh well...). 

In summary, Murder Company is a B grade WWII action flick. Its not dreadful just don't expect any Saving Private Ryan moments and you'll be fine. One for a slow afternoon or evening.",5.0
1284874,Instruments of a Beating Heart,"Yikes but the amount of clutter kids take to school these days! We join a group of first year primary school, mask-wearing, children who are tasked with performing their own version of Beethoven's instantly recognisable ""Ode to Joy"". There's going to be a series of auditions and they are going to test these youngsters as they not only have to have some competence to play the big drum, cymbal. tambourine etc, but to have the confidence to engage in this whole selection process - one where they cannot all win. It's Ayame who is desperate for one such honour, but can she overcome her own nerves and her fellow students to make the grade? The kids seem perfectly oblivious to the presence of the camera as they playfully and naturally compete. There are teary moments, fretful ones and there's the odd strop but essentially this is quite a powerful endorsement of the patience and skill of the teachers who manage to instil in their pupils a sense of participation, commitment and competitiveness without ever becoming aggressive or angry. This is clearly a well resourced school and the youngsters are actively encouraged to take part in a great many activities designed to introduce and develop their senses of inter-reliance and friendship, and there are more than enough characters here for us to engage. It also offers us a rather depressing reminder of the travails of ""social distancing"" and somehow those plastic screens seem even more alienating in this emotionally-charged environment, but they don't detract from the overall aim of working together positively, creatively and enjoyably. Thankfully, there is no recorder in their repertoire but even so, I might do without ever hearing this tune again!",7.0
1277783,The Commandant's Shadow,"To be honest, I was a little disappointed with this documentary. Occasionally using some truly gruesome archive footage, we are introduced to Hans Höss, the son of the the man who not just commanded the infamous Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp, but who was largely instrumental in creating the complex in the first place. Loosely using a narration from the autobiography he wrote whilst awaiting trail after the war, we learn a little of the politics that drove this efficient administrator to build a facility that ended up killing ten thousand people a day, whilst seemingly silent at home with his family about just what his day job actually was. Meantime, in London, we meet survivor Anita Lasker-Wallfisch. She's a remarkably stoic character who believes that there is little to be gained by raking over old coals. This is a constant source of chagrin for her daughter Maya, who seems to be living a life that sees her suffer vicariously. It's as if she believes that she has inherited some of her mother's fears and trauma and it's nigh on impossible for her to find closure. To that end, she is determined to reclaim her German citizenship and leave the UK to live in her motherland despite not having a word of German. The gist of the remainder of the film sets out to challenge just how much Hans (he was around four years old at the time) may have known about his father's activities. Has his brain intentionally shut out any memories of these atrocities or does he know more than he claims? It's this slightly confrontational aspect that didn't sit so well with me. There's something bordering on the accusatory about the way in which this man, now eighty years old, is being interviewed - and by his own pastor son Kai, too. Indeed, as we progress the thrust shifts more to the needs of these adult children rather than maintain a more interesting focus on the story of those who were both at the camp at the same time - separated by a thin brick wall that might as well have been a mile wide. The last five minutes generates amongst the most poignant scenarios I've seen on television when the two meet - and that's what I wanted far more of. The blameless child and the blameless victim having an honest chat over a coffee and some strudel about what they remembered, what they knew and most importantly, how mankind might learn from this and just what does it mean to be God's 'chosen people' - indeed for families of considerable faith, just where was God in all of this? With the rise of nationalism and anti-semitism in Europe, could the unthinkable ever actually happen again? It could have been fascinating just to sit and listen to them. Perhaps that wasn't an option - at times Anita didn't seem quite so engaged with the whole process, perhaps having erected her own psychosomatic walls to protect her from the ghastliness of her experiences as she approaches her own significant milestone. These sort of documentaries won't be possible for too much longer, and this is definitely heart-rending, occasionally a little humorous and thought-provoking, but I think just the two with some Riesling would have delivered much more intimate and powerfully.",7.0
1203653,Exhibiting Forgiveness,"No matter what anyone might say, and regardless of how virtuous its impact may be, extending forgiveness to another is nevertheless often difficult. While it’s true that the benefits to come from it can be considerable, reaching that point generally requires overcoming significant pain, resentment and disappointment. Such is the case for Tarrell (André Holland), a gifted and successful artist whose work is in great demand. However, the profound artistry behind his paintings stems largely from his difficult upbringing, having been raised mostly by his loving mother, Joy (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor), after she booted Tarrell’s abusive, drug-addicted father, La’Ron (John Earl Jelks), from their home. Despite the departure of the source of that agony, the pain of Tarrell’s existence has lingered ever since, and his painting has served as an important form of de facto therapy. But the roots of his anguish remain, and he has difficulty getting past his past – that is, until his long-absent dad reappears in his life. Trying as it might be, this unexpected reunion presents an opportunity for Tarrell, Joy and La’Ron to work through their ordeal, but are they up to it? That’s what writer-director Titus Kaphar’s debut feature seeks to do, a story drawn in part from his own experience and featuring paintings created by the filmmaker himself. Through this story, the act of forgiveness is explored from myriad angles, unflinchingly depicting the pain and difficulty involved in achieving it. The picture also shows how the impact of such torment can “unwittingly” extend to others, including ostensibly innocent bystanders like Tarrell’s wife, Aisha (Andra Day), who puts her own career as a musician on hold while she attempts to help her husband sort out his issues, a simmering source of strain in their marriage. This is all effectively brought to life through an artistically beautiful, gorgeously photographed production, backed by an emotive and engaging soundtrack. Admittedly, the pacing could use a little shoring up in spots, and the emotional depth that seemingly should have infused the writing for certain scenes doesn’t quite reach the peak that it could have, but those drawbacks are well camouflaged by the fine performances of the ensemble, especially Holland and Ellis-Taylor, who deliver some of the best work of their careers. Most importantly, though, “Exhibiting Forgiveness” is definitely a movie with a powerful message, and it makes no effort to conceal it. It drives home its point with forcefulness and clarity, as well as fearless, unapologetic candor, successfully avoiding the pitfall of sugarcoating, soft peddling or sanitizing how challenging a process extending forgiveness can be. We could all learn a lot from that – and, considering the state of affairs in our world these days, it would behoove us if we did.",7.0
1175161,Agak Laen,"<em>'Agak Laen'</em> may be a bit all over the place in terms of tone, but it is quite a fun flick all in all. It's well made too, it oddly gave me vibes of 2018's <em>'The Festival'</em>, particularly lighting-wise, for some reason - I didn't think I'd be making a connection between those two!

Oki Rengga, Boris Bokir, Indra Jegel and Bene Dion make for good casting, they fit as a four and do come across as a friends group. Rengga and Bokir are the standouts, for me. Arie Kriting is the one I'd rank highest of the other cast members; all of whom are absolutely fine, at worst.

The plot is a strange choice, I gotta say, for a comedy, I'm not convinced by how they blend it together but it works; even if the more sincere moments didn't quite hit as intended, at least to me. Oki's part at the conclusion is the closest a non-comedy bit came to hitting.

Also, the product placement is kinda mad, proper egregious stuff. This is my first taste of Indonesian cinema, I assume this is the norm? I only guess that because I do know that their football broadcasts are/were ad-heavy; that's how I know what Torabika is, lol.",7.0

1241486,解密,"There are quite a few similarities with ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"" (2015) in this film about the prodigious mathematical genius of Rong Jinzhen. By pure fluke, his problem-solving skills are spotted by teacher (Daniel Wu) who adopts the orphaned, rather subdued, boy into his close-knit family and provides him the opportunity to thrive. Over the next couple of hours we watch him (Haoran Liu) develop into an academic then into a man crucial to the efforts of his embryonic country as it struggles to recover from years of internal strife and to compete with the more established regional powers like the UK and the USA. It's to that latter nation that his Polish-born mentor ""Liseiwicz"" (John Cusack) escapes when the Kuomintang government in China falls and the communists take over - and these two men, on opposite sides of the world, soon become the epitome of intellectual rivals with the erstwhile pupil now working for the Chinese equivalent of Bletchley Park trying to keep pace with the incredibly complex ""purple"" and ""black"" ciphers being developed by the American National Security Agency. What's clear is the two men are being manipulated but their respective states and that is having - as Lieseiwicz predicted early on - quite a profound effect on their respective mental health and on Jinzhen's marriage to Ye Xiaoning. I quite liked the innovative way in which director Sicheng Chen tried to tell this tory. His use of the bizarre and the surreal amidst the more standard photography serves to give us an insight into just how un-lateral the thinking of these two men was when developing and cracking these codes with billions of potential permutations. The use of chess as a theme testing intellectual rigour works quite well too as does the sense that these two men and being used to play a game by their superiors that always looks likely to end in stalemate. Cusack does fine here, though maybe he over-does the maniacal aspects of his thought processes a little, but it's Haoran Liu who delivers more engagingly as the geeky, socially inept, scientist whose brain becomes like a train running out of control. This does have a slight element of jingoism to the narrative, the People's Republic being the bastion of all freedoms fighting the Imperialist West, but that's really only a sideline as the story of one man's impressive skills with cerebral gymnastics unfolds. It is too long: it does plod at times, but when it hits it's stride, it's interesting and attempts to show us a little of the character of these two men against a backdrop of a good looking production. A story of two addicts, really.",6.0
1157680,從今以後,"They say that “blood is thicker than water,” an observation that can manifest in many ways. This often becomes most apparent during times of crisis, such as when a death occurs or an inheritance is involved (money being on the line frequently speaks volumes). So it is in the fourth feature outing from writer-director Ray Yeung, which tells the touching story of long-tenured same-sex couple Angie (Patra Au) and Pat (Maggie Li Lin Lin), a duo very much in love. They’ve lived in the same Hong Kong apartment for 30 years and have enjoyed reasonably good relations with their relatives, most notably Pat’s extended family. However, when Pat unexpectedly dies, matters become complicated, particularly when it comes to recognizing Angie’s status and her relation to her late partner. That includes such issues as deciding the handling of Pat’s remains, as well as the final dispensation of her considerable assets, including those she jointly held with her beloved. Relations suddenly become strained, if not downright ugly, with a woman they’ve long seemed to accept as a member of the family. This is especially apparent when Pat’s relations try to grab all they can in an effort to solve the many fiscal problems that they’ve brought upon themselves. As all of this plays out, viewers thus witness the stark contrast that exists between the loving bond that the couple forged for one another and what Pat’s relatives have created for themselves in their largely failed attempts at making a supposedly healthy and successful family, a comparison deftly and sensitively yet candidly presented by the filmmaker. While this story may not be especially original, its pacing can be a tad slow and its overall handling may at times be a little too deliberate, this picture nevertheless packs quite a powerful emotional punch, superbly depicted in the stellar performances of the excellent ensemble cast, backed by beautiful cinematography and a subdued atmospheric background score. “All Shall Be Well” is, without a doubt, one of 2024’s underrated gems, a film that will both move and incense audiences, particularly when it comes to distinguishing what’s legally permissible and what’s ethically proper, especially in matters of love and what constitutes “family.”",7.0

1081593,Домаќинство за почетници,"Alternative “family” structures have been around for some time now, and they’ve assumed a variety of forms, both domestically and overseas, as well as in their essential composition. And, in a number of cases, it has taken some trial and error to figure out what works best for these diverse groupings, depending on the various factors that characterize the individuals involved. Such is the case in this profile of a multi-ethnic, mostly LGBTQ+ household in Skopje, North Macedonia that struggles to find a harmonious footing when stricken by a tragedy involving a family matriarch (Alina Serban). Those left behind (Anamaria Marinca, Vladimir Tintor, Samson Selim) must figure out how to regroup, particularly when it comes to the care of a belligerent adolescent (Mia Mustafa) and her sweet, young, surprisingly worldly half-sister (Dzada Selim). It’s especially challenging for those in charge, given that they’re not terribly experienced at (nor overly interested in) the responsibility for such matters. They truly find themselves engaged in a crash course of “housekeeping for beginners,” one that finds them with one foot each in the middle class world of Skopje and in the impoverished world of nearby Shutka, an enclave of Roma (a.k.a. “Gypsy”) culture. Writer-director Goran Stolevski’s third feature outing provides an intriguing look at life in locales that have not received much cinematic attention, depicted through the eyes of an eclectic mix of characters living lives far different from what one typically finds in most conventional households. This domestic comedy-drama gets off to a somewhat rocky start, mainly due to a failure in identifying the nature of the relationships among the principals, and a narrative that can be rather episodic at times, with resolutions to its multiple story threads that feel incomplete or end abruptly (most notably in the final act). Viewers probably would have benefitted from some additional information about the ethnic backgrounds of the characters, too, given that many viewers are likely unfamiliar with the cultures involved. However, once the picture starts settling down and finding its rhythm, this release definitely gets stronger and more involving as it progresses, touching audiences profoundly, given that the situations that arise are often universal in nature, no matter what structure a family unit takes. “Housekeeping for Beginners” definitely has its strengths and touching moments; it’s a little disappointing, though, that there aren’t more of them. Greater clarification and consistency in the storytelling would have done this offering a world of good in its depiction of a world otherwise seldom seen.",6.0

954802,Seize Them!,"Does anyone remember ""Boudica"" (2019)? Well this is in the same sort of vein but a little better. ""Dagan"" (Aimee Lou Wood) is the hated queen of a realm that is being taken over by the woman-of-the-people who is ""Humble Joan"" (Nicola Coughlan doing her best Jeanette Krankie impersonation) who has discovered the power of gunpowder. Luckily for the overthrown queen, she has one loyal servant and she - ""Shulmay (Lolly Adefope) has her head screwed on well enough to get them to safety. Then it's a trek 140 miles to the sea where they are to meet the queen's foreign relatives who have apparently promised military aide. En route they encounter the nice-but-dim ""Bobik"" (Nick Frost) and have some adventures staying one step ahead of the pursuing turncoat ""Leofwine"" (Jessica Hynes) and avoiding potential betrayal in every village where people would happily turn them in for the 200 pieces of silver reward. This might have done better as an half hour comedy sketch, but stretching it out for ninety minutes was a mistake. There's nowhere near enough substance in either the script nor the characterisations to sustain it for that long. Wood is quite funny for the first five minutes as the stroppy and spoilt woman with the legendary perfect feet and a crown, but there's only so much toilet humour I can be bothered with before I start to look around the cinema at others doing the same. There's a little very black comedy at the end but by then I was largely disinterested. It's a film for the television on a dark night after a few beers when you've got some mates in. As a piece of stand-alone cinema, even with what must have been a pretty shoestring budget, it's a bit puerile and really quite disappointing.",6.0

1353263,The Bibi Files,"Using what looks like some clandestine filming of interviews, Alexis Bloom offers us a critique on the personality that has led Israel for four terms as it's Prime Minister. At this point it's probably worth pointing out that if you are an any way a protagonist of this man, his methods, beliefs and principals then this is not a documentary that you're likely to love. Indeed, throughout it's two hour duration there are few with a good word to say about the man. From the perspective of a neutral ""observer"", that's fine but the lack of balance and it's nature as a piece of rather shameless character assassination does render it impotent after about half an hour. Certainly this man was charming and charismatic; I remember him regularly appearing on British television as a spokesman for a nation that seemed to be living in a constant state of siege. Now he needs to answer his own questions. Does the end ever justify the means? What he is trying to achieve is ""total victory"" for his people. Does that mean perpetual warfare, complete annihilation of their foes, territorial expansion? He is seen with both Trump and Putin; he addresses an applauding Congress in Washington D.C. and yet the editorial here is so obviously skewed against him that all it does for me is bring into question the relative merits of all of our ""democratic"" leaders. From the interior of his less than sumptuous office we don't get any sense of a structured investigation into his alleged corruption. We, instead, witness what appear to be some informal spatting sessions between a man in a tie and some others in uniform. There is no arbiter, no sense of the seriousness of what's being discussed. It's not just about a few cars or a bottle of Louis Roderer, but the judicious use of political power in return for favours. Nicholas Sarkozy is currently on trial for corruption. Donald Trump is on the wrong end of almost $500 millions in fines and compensation. It's hardly an uniquely Israeli problem, and neither Germany nor Canada are sheltering armies of terrorists or missile launchers. Power corrupts. Fact! Is he grooming a dynasty? Is he using his office to shield himself from investigation? Is he trying to geld the Supreme Court? Does his wife Sara really pull the strings? Well possibly, probably - even almost certainly, but the absence of contributions from any of his proponents left me thinking this was just a hatchet job done by those on the left - traditional home of the moral high ground; without actually structuring a critical assessment of a man who leads a nation that's divided, and divided profoundly along grounds of religion zealousness and territorial ambitions. It seems to suggest he is some sort of despot, but again - show me a nation in that part of the world where leadership is not concentrated in the hands of one man, family, tribe? The very fact the people are free to take to the streets and protest has to be worth noting. The last twenty minutes veers perilously close to suggesting that he used or procured funds to prop up the regimes he is now so actively fighting and, indeed, that many other nations are complicit in this game of regional dominoes. That could have made for an interesting discussion in itself if it had been presented in a less simplistically linear fashion. Tunnels under hospitals for hostages or sewage pipes? Yes, it stimulates debate but only if you are prepared to look past it's obvious blinkers and accept the man represents a significant section of a radically polarising nation. Is he cause or effect, both or neither? Sadly, you won't really find any answers here.",6.0
1300245,"I Am Ready, Warden","Nobody has been executed here in the UK since 1948 so it's quite difficult to get my head around a society that not only still condones state killings but, more disgustingly from my perspective, has a television programme called ""Execution Watch"". This short documentary follows the last week of John Henry Ramirez who has spent years on death row for a killing he openly admitted. Now he has found Christ and the new DA has requested that the death penalty be commuted to life without possibility of parole. It's not because he's a Christian that he has asked for this, but more because he has his own moral objections to this whole process of punishment. This new approach has it's supporters and detractors and we hear from both - including the murdered man's family. It's presented clumsily and as if it were an hastily cobbled together news feature - complete with repeated soundbites and lingering photography that made it look more like a staged drama than a serious look at how people deal with something quite this visceral when it touches their lives. There's always going to be debate about this ultimate penalty, but I am afraid this does little to inform that discussion and is really quite disappointing.",6.0

1214521,Daughters,"A group of incarcerated fathers are promised the opportunity to have a dance with their young daughters after they undergo some sessions with a counsellor who encourages discussion between them about what the relationship with their children means to each of them. Meantime, we are introduced to the entertainingly enthusiastic Aubrey who is desperate to see her father and who serves as a conduit to other mothers and children who are - with varying degrees of wholeheartedness - involved in this project. Across the next hundred minutes or so, we follow the preparation and anticipation on both sides before the children duly arrive for their brief and emotional afternoon. What got me about this whole thing is the director's decision not to inform us as to just why these men are in jail in the first place. With sentences ranging from the short to thirty years, I quickly felt I was being lured into a feeling of sympathy for individuals about whom I knew practically nothing. As none of the men themselves seemed keen to elaborate own what crimes actually put them in jail, I began to wonder if they were just hard-luck, petty, thieves or serial rapists. Might the youngsters actually be better off without their dads? It's set amidst a prison in Washington D.C. so it does offer us an occasionally interesting look at some aspects of African American familial culture and attitudes but again, it doesn't try to put much meat on any bones from the perspective of the spouses about coping or raising the children in difficult circumstances. The aim of the scheme to reconcile (compulsorily) estranged fathers and daughters is laudable enough, but this documentary really only presents us with a rather incomplete and selective character study. It might work better as a two-part television documentary, but as a cinema piece it's a bit of an unrewarding slog.",6.0
1124509,Hostile Dimensions,"Maybe not since Cecil B. De Mille have I heard the word smite in a movie, but it’s here towards the end of this “Blair Witch” meets “Solo Levelling” low budget bobbins. I know I ought to be more supportive of my native independent sector, but this is just a mess of a film that Graham Jones must have thought looked good on the storyboard but that is where it ought to have stayed. It’s all about a video that teases documentary film makers “Sam” (Annabelle Logan) and “Ash” (Joma West) with a conundrum. It shows us a couple of budding Banksy’s exploring what looks like some derelict tunnels when they discover a stand-alone door frame with the door firmly shut. They can clearly observe both sides of this solitary object but still they open it and…. What happens next? Well our intrepid duo soon find themselves playing inter-dimensional “It’s a knockout” as they unite with “Brian” (Hughes) to get to the bottom of the mystery. I did actually quite like the mischief in the premise and at times there are glimmers from the writing that bely the fact that this can’t have much cash or time to accomplish it’s goal, but seriously - it comes across as a student project. Constant swearing doesn’t constitute comedy writing, slapstick is actually a precision art (probably why I don’t much care for it at the best of times) not something that becomes funny because Harold Lloyd used to do it. Acting isn’t just about being yourself amongst friends having a lark, you have to attempt to create characters that we can engage with. We don’t have to like them, but we have to have some sort of hook else why would we care where this door does, or doesn’t, lead. There’s nowhere near enough focus on what we are supposed to be looking at or for and even the presence of a talking “Toto” couldn’t make the story anywhere near cohesive enough to get into. Logan is certainly the most natural of the talent on display here but otherwise, this is a later night television project after a few pints that you might get a giggle from, but that’s only a “might”!",5.0
979250,டிமான்டி காலனி 2,"Although the movie starts with a recap, you might want to first watch the first part. At that time, even with a lot of horror tropes, Demonte Colony felt refreshing and grounded, at least admits the numerous Tamil comedy horror movies. I wasn't excited about the sequel, when I watched the trailer. I did watch it, because it was supposed to be at least a good sequel. And that's my impression, too.

I didn't like Demonte Colony 2 as a movie on its own. Personally I don't consider it a horror movie. If you like more action-oriented loud horror movies, this might be your cup of tea. The action and in general the daring technological efforts impressed me, even if for the most part you can see the limited budget in the outcome. Other than that, the movie was disturbed by unnecessary comedic relief a few times. Some of the acting was unbearable. It also managed to embarrass both spiritual and scientific knowledge in a single line.

However I loved how it builds on top of the first movie. Furthermore I'm excited about the mystery and the lore added to this series. Demote Colony 2 may not have entertained me, but I do not regret watching it.",6.0
977966,Drift,"To be honest, I was a little disappointed with this story. It's clear that Cynthia Erivo has put her heart and soul into it, but the story just has too many holes in it for me. We first meet her ""Jacqueline"" character as she wanders the streets of a small greek island town pinching the sugar sachets. Quickly, we discover that she has barely more than the clothes she stands up in, sleeps on a blanket in a sheltered cave and gets about blagging trips on tourist buses. Via flashbacks we are told of her privileged background in her native Liberia and of a love affair with a British woman (Honor Swinton Byrne) in London, and what's clear is that neither idyll seems destined to endure. The former, indeed, is played out across the course of the film in a rather brutally predicable fashion. Fortunately, she encounters tour guide ""Callie"" (Alia Shawkat) who's getting a bit fed up with the day-in day-out routine with her elderly visitors who just want to say they've ""done"" the place. Gradually the two start to bond and maybe there's a little light at the end of the tunnel for ""Jacqueline""? Both women deliver well enough here, but there are just too many elements missing or under-developed. How did she get here for a start? Too much of her trauma has to be assumed or guessed at and not that I wanted graphic scenes, I did want to know a little more about just what made ""Jacqueline"" tick. The production is all adequate, and for a while the repetitive photography serves well to illustrate the dead-end nature of her existence, but I just think this missed an opportunity to develop the story of ""Jacqueline"" a bit more comprehensively.",6.0
974613,The Fabulous Four,"“The Fabulous Four” suffers from such an identity crisis that it feels like a tale of two movies. The first hour is goofy, lazy, and falls almost completely flat, while the second half redeems itself with a heartfelt sincerity. It’s a sweet story aimed at senior women, and they’re going to love it.

Lou (Susan Sarandon), Kitty (Sheryl Lee Ralph), and Alice (Megan Mullally) have been buddies for a long time. The gang reunites to travel to Key West to be bridesmaids in the surprise wedding of their best college girlfriend, Marilyn (Bette Midler). As with all reunions, some old wounds are opened. But after a few days of laughs, tears, and adventure, even stronger bonds are formed between the women.

The first half of the film is borderline dreadful, breathlessly treading in too-familiar waters. The script is dumbed-down and predictable, with a setup that makes it indistinguishable from many other AARP comedies The humor is hit or miss, leaning heavily on dopey slapstick and over-the-top scenarios and antics that don’t always land. This portion of the film feels incredibly lazy, almost as if director Jocelyn Moorhouse is simply going through the motions, blindfolded, while setting up the real story.

Once the film transitions to its more dramatic elements, it finds its footing. The second half is a heartfelt exploration of friendship, aging, and acceptance, and the themes of rekindling sisterhood and confronting the past are handled with a genuine touch, offering moments of true emotional resonance. This part of the film showcases what could have been if the entire movie maintained this level of quality.

The cast is terrific, and Sarandon stands out with a particularly strong performance. All of these women play well off each other, and they have a natural comedic chemistry. I’ve said it before and will continue to do so, but it is always refreshing to see roles for actors over 60 (particularly females), and all of these women make the most of it. Even better, everyone seems like they want to be here, which isn’t the case with similar films.

Other things to love range from the film’s casual and open acceptance of LGBTQ+ characters to the warm and comforting story of friendship that’s downright irresistible. With the good, of course, comes the bad, like the overt product placement for TikTok and an inexplicably stiff cameo from singer Michael Bolton that is one of the most bizarre appearances in a movie, ever. (He is awkward and unnatural in a way that screams “get me out of here!”).

When it comes to movies about older women, Hollywood still can’t seem to get the recipe just right. In that regard, I guess it’s progress that at least half of “The Fabulous Four” is done well.

Firstly lets establish a simple point, this is a watchable film. Its a South Korean take on ""The Exorcist"" in many respects and what it does do, it does well. The story is both cleverly crafted and creepily original. Which in turn, is built upon, by excellent performances, from the cast and suitably austere and bleak, cinematography.

What does not work so well, is this film is overly long. This is due to its tendency to both over explain and repeat aspects, of the story. The result, for the viewer, is still a decent cinematic experience but it does see this film, tend to squander, its scare potential.

In summary, a worthwhile horror tale that could have been better again, with a more concise, economical script, that better focused the core story and in so doing, upped the fear factor, for the viewer.",6.0

1223050,Roadkill,"**_A killer is loose on the rural roads of the Florida Panhandle_**

In 1983, a comely teenager in a red Nova (Caitlin Carmichael) picks up a troubled long-haired hitchhiker (Ryan Knudson) and the mounting bodies naturally attract the local sheriff (Warren Fast, who also happens to be the writer/director).

“Roadkill” (2024) takes the killer-on-the-road theme of flicks like “Kalifornia” or “Midnight in the Switchgrass” and meshes it with the Southern milieu and car chases of “Smokey and the Bandit,” minus the comedy. It may be throwaway entertainment that’s hollow and somewhat slow burn, but it worked for me for what it is. The director well captures Caitlin’s beauty without resorting to tasteless sleaze. 

The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in Ebro, in the heart of the Florida Panhandle, and areas nearby (Bay County and Washington County).

1311537,误杀3,"When the daughter of a wealthy businessman is kidnapped from his home, the police (Yihong Duan) are called just as the felons demand $100 millions as a ransom. ""Zheng Bingrui"" (Yang Xiao) has little faith in the authorities so decides to pay, and to follow the instructions for delivery he's getting over the phone. The girl's teacher ""Li Huiping"" (Liya Tong) feels partially responsible and insists on accompanying him. With cameras, trackers and microphones almost everywhere, we now follow their frankly rather preposterous journey and along the way learn a little about just what is motivating the criminals to persecute this outwardly upstanding citizen. There is plenty of action at the start, and as the underlying story starts to evolve, the plot becomes quite sophisticated in it's search for explanations and revenge, but sadly the acting isn't up to much and it really does lose it's way as it heads to a denouement that I found rather a convoluted cop out. There is one scene, incidental to most of the actual plot, that I did find subtly harrowing. A young lad is innocently bouncing up and down in his new light-up shoes whilst his mum fills out some forms at a nearby counter. Then he's gone. A victims of child kidnappers who will hope to sell him to wealthy ""westerners"" for up to $50,000! That's the punchy message that this film does deliver. It showcases the abhorrently profitable practice of trafficking in young children and the lengths to which parents will go, in anger and despair, to find them and or to avenge this epitome of cruelty as well as those to which the perpetrators will go regardless of the misery they cause.

1198904,Atatürk II 1881 – 1919,"""Ataturk II offers up a gripping insight into the life and events,surrounding the man most credited with creating the modern secular Turkish state. 

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was both a soldier and a politician over the course of his life. This film focuses on what is arguably the most tumultuous period of his life, including the Gallipoli campaign of world war one, that made Ataturk a household name, setting him on the path to national leadership.

What I did applaud and its to this films credit it is does not glorify war. Quite the contrary. It depicts war in all its bleak brutality. It offers insights into how the war impacted on Ataturk, with what is probably his most famous and moving speech, surprisingly not only to the memory of his fallen comrades but those they fought.

Its made clear Ataturk understands the bitter necessity for conflict but derives no pleasure from it. Ataturk is a nationalist at heart, who fights because he's protecting home and hearth. 

Sets, cinematography and acting are superb. The only criticism and this may escape non English speaking audiences is the American accented Churchill and the officer who reports to him, for whom English, is clearly not, his first language.

1082543,National Anthem,"“Dylan” (Charlie Plummer) lives with his mum and younger brother and works, where he can, in construction to put food on the table. One day, he picks up some work with a travelling rodeo circus - loads of aspiring Buffalo Bills. The thing is, most of them are gay and aside from roping the ponies they put on some drag shows and have all the concomitant relationship issues that you’d expect to find amongst a community that is tightly night and highly strung. He is welcomed by all, and swiftly takes a shine to “Sky” (Eve Lindley) who is in an open relationship with “Pepe” (Rene Rosado) and for the rest of this film we follow that turbulent scenario set against more of his own family’s discord and his own desires to save his cash to buy an SUV and travel the land. There is something really quite visceral about Plummer’s efforts here and the grand expanse of scenery is really well captured by the photography, but the story. It’s all just too safe. It’s sort of like inserting a straight dynamic into “Priscilla, Queen of the Desert”, only this really does lack for much humour and is, especially towards the end, a rather earnest and plodding melodrama that I thought just ran out of steam. It’s a story about love, lust and acceptance, but delivers nothing we haven’t seen before across an whole range of cinema genres.

1156649,Mountain Queen: The Summits of Lhakpa Sherpa,"Next time you are in the supermarket, have a look at the staff and imagine that one of them has climbed Mount Everest ten times! That's the story of this illiterate Nepali woman who has struggled to bring up her two daughters, hold together an increasingly violent marriage and then work with her brother at home in Nepal to lead teams of people to the top of the world's highest peak. What's clear from the outset here is she is an immensely grounded and humble woman who has a deep respect for the mountain: she even asks it's permission before ascending (and assumes force eight winds and avalanches is it saying no!). Using her latest attempt in 2018 as the starting point for the story, we are introduced to her daughters - Shiny, who is accompanying her mother on the trip, and the not so aptly named Sunny who, at 19, is staying at home. It's never been an easy ride for Lhakpa Sherpa. She couldn't even get a job as a porter when she started out - women weren't deemed to be strong enough, but her perseverance eventually convinced the then Prime Minister to encourage women to take a more active part in the business of the mountain. She meets and later marries Romanian climber George Dijmarescu and the pair become a formidable team as her summit's start to mount up, but he had baggage of his own stemming from a poverty-stricken youth in Romania and a dependency on the bottle which adds to the trauma for both her and to her troubles at their home in Connecticut. The photography both current and archive is frankly quite breathtaking, illustrating the bleak hostility of the almost lunar terrain and by the end of this documentary, I thought she made it look almost straightforward (even if she does admit, in her mid-40s - to feeling ""a little crappy"" at 25,000 feet!). There's something engaging about Lhakpa Sherpa. A woman dedicated, respectful and loving who is certainly addicted to the outdoor life, but who is clearly motivated to do all she can to support and educate her daughters. It's hard to imagine that she will ever stop and it wouldn't surprise me if she were to inspire one of her daughters, and a great many Nepali women, to follow in her footsteps.",7.0
995808,L'Étoile filante,"It’s always frustrating to walk out of a movie and ask yourself afterward, “What did I just watch?” That was my reaction to this scattered, unfocused offering from the writing-directing duo of Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon, and that’s unfortunate given that this release has some definite strengths in its corner. This tale tells the story of a radical activist (Abel) who’s been on the run since 1986 and has been laying low of late by working as a bartender in a corner dive known as The Falling Star. However, when he’s approached by a mysterious stranger with a malfunctioning prosthetic arm (Bruno Romy) in search of revenge, he must go back into hiding, although this time he does so by putting up an unwitting, easily manipulated lookalike double (also Abel) in his place. It’s an all-too-familiar narrative in which audiences are bound to know in advance that things are going to go very wrong when the plan is implemented. In this case, though, viewers are unlikely to figure on just how wrong they’ll go – and it has nothing to do with the nature of carefully crafted humorous incidents designed to evoke hearty laughs. Rather, the woefully errant plotline unfolds with a series of disjointed, unrelated bits that rarely work and seldom connect. The picture truly plays like a work that was made up as its creators as they went along, taking a pile of comic possibilities and throwing them all at the wall to see what sticks. There’s an especially heavy reliance on slapstick, some of which is admittedly inspired but most of which plays like the dysfunctional routines Woody Allen tried to pull off in some of his early films. And, the further one gets into the story, the more it comes across like a protracted improv exercise, including everything from music video-style dance routines to surreal flashbacks to embarrassingly rampant silliness. There are also some lame attempts at incorporating social commentary, which largely comes out of left field and has only a tangential nexus to the principal story thread. As noted earlier, all of this is regrettable, too, considering the elements that the film does have going for it – a modestly interesting, potential-filled premise, an exquisite production design, a deftly chosen soundtrack and an overall stylish look, especially in the cinematography. However, the filmmakers don’t know how to harness these attributes and fashion them into a cohesive, attention-holding story. The closer this one got to the end, the more I couldn’t wait for it to be over, despite its comparatively short 1:38:00 runtime. Indeed, there are plenty of falling stars in this cinematic disaster, but I have to wonder how many of them were planned by its makers.",3.0

The message here is about as subtle as an air raid, but that's probably the clarity of message that makes more sense to young children who want to see animals free to roam in their natural habitat and not living in a sort of zoological version of the ""Truman Show"". To complete the doctrine, we have a go at corporate greed and misinformation and that's maybe where the characterisations perk up a bit - Donald Sutherland voiced the English language version as his menacing albino crocodile did a little of the company's enforcing for them. The animation is fine and the story flows along predictably, but adequately, for an hour and an half as it delivers it's simplistic planet-loving credentials to an unchallenging audience. Is it all about the butterfly effect? Well if there is point to social media influencers, then you do have to wonder...",6.0
1274238,blur: To the End,"I was always more of a ""Blur"" fan than an ""Oasis"" one, but to be honest I'd forgotten completely why they had split up. This fly-on-the-wall documentary tries to fill in some of the gaps as it reunites the four members of the band who are going to record their first new album in decades and do a little mini-tour of some ""intimate"" venues before a couple of gigs in front of eighty-odd thousand people at London's Wembley stadium. The film is centred around Damon Albarn's home in the South West of England and as Graham Coxon (anyone else think he's turning into Dudley Moore?), renowned cheesemaker Alex James and Dave Rowntree turn up it seems that there's a lot of forgiving and forgetting going on. There's a conversational candour from all four about their demise as a band. They couldn't stand the sight of one another - hardly surprising after living in each other's pockets for years, but it's clear that there is still something compelling, addictive even, about their relationships that will either float or sink this ambitions project that is proving nerve-wracking even now, after years of performing. I could have been doing with more of their music, if only to remind me there was more to them than ""Boys and Girls"" and ""Parklife"", and I could have done with less of their political hypocrisy as they live in safe conservative parliamentary seats whilst espousing urbanite socialism - but when it comes down to it, they are just four formerly quite handsome guys (yes, I know that's reductive!) who knew how to put lyrics and music into a format that mischievously and vibrantly entertained on a stage and on a television at a time when music in Britain was undoubtedly suffering from a creative malaise that was crying out for something different, energetic and powerful. I liked the style of this documentary and I liked the very fact that it's an episode in the lives of these four, now quite different, men. What happens next is anyone's guess.",7.0
1163029,Popular Theory,"The script, while quite predictable, somehow manages to draw you in. There's a compelling element that keeps you engaged, perhaps the charm of simplicity combined with a touch of humor and innocence.

The movie does an excellent job of conveying its message, skillfully portraying life lessons in a manner that's easy for children to understand. It even succeeds in making the audience understand the main antagonist in a convincing way. The editing is well done, especially for a low-budget film.

Speaking of performances, the child actors are really good and have chemistry. The film is not just fun but also sprinkles plenty of laughs throughout, making it a delightful watch for both children and adults who appreciate a light-hearted, feel-good family movie.",8.0
1135176,家庭简史,"The young loner “Yuan Sho” (Xilun Sun) has an incident at school that sees him helped by the “Wei” (Muran Lin) who takes him to the nurse. That’s the start of a friendship that sees the injured lad introduced to his friend’s kindly mum (Ke-Yu Guo) and rather aloof scientist dad (Feng Zu) who take a shine to him as his vulnerability awakens hitherto subdued feelings with the adults whom, it emerges, might have liked more than just the one son - but who had to adhere to the prevailing one-child policy of the time. “Yuan Sho” clearly has baggage of his own and as the story unfolds you might expect it to take a predictable route, but it doesn’t. Indeed, as the plot develops and we learn more about what makes these characters tick, it starts to become quite an enigmatic story where uncertainty creeps in and stirs up the mix nicely as we head to a conclusion that is, in itself, inconclusive. It’s the effort from Xilun Sun that delivers best here, and with plenty of Bach mixed into a story of parental ambition, teenage indifference and just an hint of what might or might not be manipulation, we are left with a psychologically layered story with a bit of a difference.",7.0
1107054,MIKI,"Miki's a Slovakian take on the gangster, organised crime, genre. 

It took ,me a while to warm to this film. Its initially slow pace and unfamiliar cultural vibe left it feeling somewhat uninteresting and inaccessible. That being said, if you give this film a chance, you get to see how universally familiar patterns of human behaviour, in this case, violent criminal behaviour, assert themselves. 

Miki, the main character, is a well rendered. He has a certain brutal depth to him, hes cruel, superficially charming in a rather basic way but also strangely honourable and loyal.  

Other characters, such as the violent, brother are also interesting, as is the obvious poverty and corruption in the unstable post Communist period of the early 1990's Slovakia.The period in which this film is set. You can see how financially struggling people like Miki, are ushered into the world of crime.

The closing scene where Miki's mother finally see's him for who and what he is, is subtly done but compelling. Oh and let the credits roll as there are cut scenes that round out Miki's story. 

In summary, well acted, well written, with characters who feel real and relatable. Starts off slowly but gradually becomes a rather compelling watch.",7.0
1090446,Remembering Gene Wilder,"I find it ironic that sometimes it takes something serious, like a documentary, to showcase the somewhat less than serious abilities of someone gifted at comedy, like actor-writer-director Gene Wilder (1933-2016). But that’s just what viewers can expect from director Ron Frank’s reverent but often-hilarious tribute to this iconic talent, one whose accomplishments in film, on television and on stage haven’t always received the kind of recognition that they deserve. As documentaries go, this offering largely plays it straight in terms of its content and structure, exploring Wilder’s roots in Milwaukee and chronicling his rise to fame, told in chronological sequence. But, despite this conventional approach, “Remembering Gene Wilder” offers viewers much. The film features a number of recent interviews with such collaborators as Mel Brooks, Carol Kane and Eric McCormack, as well as friends Alan Alda and Harry Connick Jr., Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz, wife Karen Wilder and an array of Hollywood production professionals. It also includes ample clips from Wilder’s films, including “Bonnie and Clyde” (1967), “The Producers” (1967), “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” (1971), “Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask)” (1972), “Blazing Saddles” (1974), “Young Frankenstein” (1974) and “See No Evil, Hear No Evil” (1989), along with his guest appearances on television’s Will & Grace (2002-2003). And then there’s plenty of archive video and still photograph footage of Wilder’s family, friends, influences and co-stars, those who helped shape him and that he, in turn, helped shape. Most importantly, though, this offering examines what made Wilder unique as an artist and as a private individual, someone known for his singular vision as a comedic (yet vulnerable) actor and as a compassionate, generous colleague toward those he loved and worked with. There’s also a touching segment examining his profound but bittersweet marriage to wife and co-star Gilda Radner (1946-1989), a heartbreaking love story that brought out these personal qualities in abundance and in a very high-profile way. The result is a surprisingly eye-opening look at its subject, revealing sides of Wilder personally and professionally that many outside of his inner circle may not have known. The overall approach of this offering may not be particularly inventive, but the result is well worth a watch nevertheless.",8.0
1082938,On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,"""Shula"" (Susan Chardy) is returning from a fancy dress party late one evening when she encounters a corpse on the road. A quick investigation reveals the body as that of her ""Uncle Fred"". She doesn't appear terribly upset at the news and neither does her partying father when she calls to tell him! Her evening doesn't get any better with the arrival of her drunken cousin ""Nsansa"" (Elizabeth Chisela) and when the police tell her they don't have enough vehicles to come and deal with it til the morning, she has to sleep in her car. What follows now sees us immersed in some of the rituals and traditions of a Zambian funeral, with grief - real and not so real - presented in a semi-comedic mix of ancient and modern behaviour. What also become clear is that ""Shula"" has a reason for her indifference and that this family, indeed their whole village, has unsavoury secrets to keep. What was curious for me, given the nature of the man's behaviour, was the extent to which the men were largely oblivious and the women almost entirely defensive of his true nature. Not of his behaviour in life, but of his reputation thereafter. He was clearly no great loss, yet his sisters grieve profoundly and lay the blame for his death squarely at his much younger wife who obviously hadn't looked after him properly. What's this to to with a guinea fowl, you might ask? Well it appears that they frequently serve as an early warning system for wildlife when predators approach, and so the allegory with the characterisation of ""Shula"" is clear to see as the story shines a light on established patterns of behaviour that still consider women as chattels. Aside from some engaging light-relief from the almost permanently sozzled ""Nsansa"", there isn't really enough development of the personas here and there's also not so much dialogue, per se. Just a great deal of plausible family chatter, angst and wailing amongst a community that treats death respectfully as the photography gets it's sleeves rolled up and takes us quite effectively into this bereft commune where there are spoils to be had, too. A lot of this is left to our own imagination and judgement, which is fine but a little lazy on the part of the writers who maybe hadn't quite the courage of their convictions when it came to delivering a more directly potent thrust, but it's still well worth a watch.",7.0
1082938,On Becoming a Guinea Fowl,"A pertinent fact about the little-known African bird known as the guinea fowl is that they have a unique, loud call that can be heard at quite a range, not only amongst their own kind, but also among all of the other animals within earshot. That can prove quite valuable both for the members of their own flock and for all other nearby vulnerable creatures when predators approach. While that may sound like useless trivia to some, it’s a highly relevant metaphorical observation about the underlying narrative in this third feature effort from Zambian writer-director Rungano Nyoni. While driving home from a dinner party late at night on a remote rural highway, Shula (Susan Chardy) comes upon the dead body of her Uncle Fred (Roy Chisha) splayed out on the road. Somewhat surprisingly, she seems largely unaffected by what most would see as a shocking discovery. She calmly reports the incident to authorities and returns home, where she finds her relatives have begun preparing the residence for a traditional funeral gathering. Shula remains remarkably composed through all this, too, despite the many disruptions going on around her, especially incessant overblown outpourings of grief. Her relatives are somewhat offended by Shula’s nonchalant behavior, upset that she doesn’t show more remorse about her uncle’s demise and isn’t particularly respectful of their arguably overwrought mourning rituals. But, as a modern professional woman, Shula is not one to readily give in to these outdated conventions and exaggerated displays of hysteria, regardless of how time-honored and widely accepted they might be. What’s more, as the story plays out, the reasoning behind Shula’s cool demeanor becomes even more apparent: She hadn’t spoken to Fred in years and wasn’t on good terms with him – and for good reason. And, as she soon comes to discover through revealing conversations with relatives like her cousins Nsansa (Elizabeth Chisela) and Bupe (Esther Singini), those reasons become even clearer, making it apparent that Fred was arguably someone unworthy of the outpouring of angst directed his way. To make matters worse, Shula also sees that her family is just as culpable for the shamefulness behind the concealment of the many dirty little (and not so little) secrets that surface, terrible truths that have been long buried under successive layers of denial and shifted blame. Indeed, if family is supposedly everything, these are relatives with whom I’d rather have no contact. As a consequence, this is the kind of film that could easily prompt viewers to become justifiably outraged while watching it, both for the damning revelations that emerge, as well as its disturbingly frank portrayal of the deplorable treatment women are sadly accorded in this culture. Interestingly enough, however, the film manages to present this unsettling story with a deft fusion of drama and dark comedy (which may not seem quite so funny when all is said and done), coupled with tinges of surrealism (some of which work, some of which don’t). Its greatest strength, though, lies in its message about the need for more of us to behave like the guinea fowl when circumstances warrant. To be sure, predators come in all forms, some of whom walk on four legs and others of whom only need two.",7.0
951029,Look Into My Eyes,"Psychic ability is a subject that often mystifies yet captivates many of us. It’s also a topic that’s frequently misunderstood and comes with a lot of distorted, uninformed baggage in need of serious clarification. Those looking to be enlightened about it, however, are unlikely to come away from director Lana Wilson’s documentary on the subject with much new or profound insight. The film profiles seven New York City psychic professionals through conversations with these individuals and footage from sessions with some of their clients. Regrettably, though, this overlong offering is in serious need of being trimmed and recut. Much of the material becomes redundant and tedious as the film progresses, and the picture frequently focuses on the wrong content. Many of the client sessions, for example, are abruptly cut short just as they’re starting to get interesting. In addition, the interviews with the psychics are at their best when they wax philosophically about the nature of this phenomenon (particularly when discussing how they became involved in this practice, often through artistic, healing and self-acceptance avenues), but there’s not nearly enough of these fascinating metaphysical musings. And then there’s a potentially intriguing collective gathering involving all seven psychics that, sadly, receives woefully short shrift, again getting clipped just as it’s becoming engaging. Instead of more of what works best in the film, viewers are left with numerous easily eliminated pregnant pauses, often-superfluous descriptions about everyday aspects of the psychics’ personal lives and overly repetitive discussion of subjects addressed in the session material (especially those involving the work of a pet psychic, an intriguing but vastly overused narrative element). “Look Into My Eyes” could have been a genuinely revelatory, insightful examination of this subject, but the filmmaker has not made the most of that golden opportunity. Instead of providing audiences with a meaningful, articulate look into the subject matter, viewers are left with a meandering, unfocused treatment of a topic that could be valuable and impactful to many of us – and that truly deserves better handling than what’s presented here.",5.0

Let's get our mates at Paramount to lend us a sound stage for the day so we can get out those old diving suits from that Jacques Cousteau documentary. Then we can make a pseudo-sci-fi yarn about three entirely interchangeable women stranded on a dark and foggy planet that appears to be being terrorised by a creature attracted to the light and with a propensity to leave huge great droppings. Perhaps, as they sift through this excrement looking for treasure, they figured it only fair that we do the same with the storyline so onwards we go in shared misery. Light? Ah, yes - what did we do with the ones from last year's Christmas tree? Perfect. Who needs a budget? Or a writer? Or a plot? Indeed, after about fifteen minutes of this really quite dreary and pace-free drama I figured that this just had to have been made as a student bet. To be fair, some of the visuals are at least as good as those in an edition of ""Space 1999"" from, say, 1975 - but the rest of this is complete non-event from start to finish. There isn't any acting to speak of, just the characters in their upturned goldfish bowls searching around in the dark for a missing son ""Luccas"" (Yes, with two c's for some reason!). Woollard tries to inject a hint of jeopardy at the end with a little double-dealing, but that is but one of ninety minutes that we shall never get back. It's the kind of film that everyone involved with will swiftly want to deny all knowledge of, and it's certainly not worth watching.",4.0
1234597,Architecton,"Did you know that after water, concrete is the most used substance on Earth? That follows on from our discovery of just adaptable stone could be. Since prehistoric times we have used it for everything from weaponry to housing, and though this doesn’t go back quite that far it uses some interesting photographic techniques to illustrate just how we incorporate it into everyday life. From time to time these images are quite cleverly presented, especially the explosive cascading of the more sedimentary and crystalline rocks that almost crumble as they descend, and there are also some rather depressing remnants of constructions that have suffered through time to now resemble something from a war zone. Sadly, though, most of the conversation adds very little to the rather repetitive nature of the film and there is an certain element of once you have seen one or two drone-shot sequences, then maybe you have seen enough. It could have been better encapsulated onto half an hour where the photography and it’s underpinning chronology could have been used to more potent effect, and the soundtrack rather adds to the blandness after a while rather than augmenting anything. It does showcase some quite differing architectural styles - human and natural, and you don’t need to be an aesthete to appreciate that some are more appealing than others, and it is worth a watch.",6.0
1156605,Wander to Wonder,"There’s something quite sad about this short feature. It’s all about three once famous kids’ television characters who have been abandoned following the end of their run on the small screen. Left to rot, really, forgotten in a fly-ridden room with only loads of old VHS cassettes of happier times, we meet the characters who epitomise so much of what we grew up watching religiously. “Mary” is still unconvinced that there aren’t still people watching somewhere as she scours the colourful letters from the fans; “Fumbleton” is a disappointed, unfulfilled, thespian and then we have “Billybud” all longing for the days when “Uncle Gilly” would take them on adventures and explore their hobbies. When something unexpected happens and their horizons perhaps broaden, red paint takes on a whole new meaning. It’s a poignant look at the simplicity of what once enthralled our younger selves and also at just how fickle we can be when things no longer appeal. I couldn’t help but think of the toys I had once cherished but that ended up discarded and broken when I lost interest. I didn’t particularly appreciate the conclusion here, but there’s something about this evocative little animation that made me smile, and wonder!",7.0

He is a gifted physics student whose teacher (Batzorig Sukhbaatar) is trying to coax him to enter a competition and focus more on his studies, but it's increasingly clear that this young man is very much the breadwinner. His recently widowed mother reverts to the bottle when things get tough and yearns to return to the rural, herding, life she had lived before marriage. Their's is a tempestuous relationship, and when things come to an head she takes their youngest away, whilst he and the elder children remain to keep up with their schooling. What follows now sees young ""Ulzii"" forced to make tough choices as he must reconcile the needs of his family with the time and effort he needs to put into his studies. A lack of coal, wood and a infection in his brother that he can't afford to medicate force him to take a path that addresses the immediacy of their needs but what of his future? I thought Uurtsaikh did well here, juggling the aspirations of a young boy who wanted to be just that, with his responsibilities as a de facto father. The actors portraying the siblings work well too, creating a sense of a family unit - they all share the same small bed - that does care for each other and all want to help. The conditions are bleak. Somehow the harsh cold always looks worse amidst an urban landscape where we are offered enough of a pretty stark comparison between even the most modest of city dwellings and his family's semi-rural existence on the outskirts. It is intense at times, but it is also quite funny too. Who knew the cure for a mouth ulcer involved a saddle-bit and a big toe?

Naturally, I don't expect much from these tele festive flicks. Still, there is still a level to reach and I don't personally believe this one hits any sort of positive standing. I'll give it minor credit for having a clear concept, as opposed to the usual flat out romance with minimal other plot points.

However, that's all the praise I have. The acting is probably its weakest element, neither of the two leads are all that watchable and the support cast don't stand out behind them. You need a bit of chemistry between those front and centre, but I didn't sense anything with these two sadly.",4.0
1283214,Wild Wild Space,"Who Will Control Our Skies? A Wild And Great Long-Term Business Documentary Covering The 'New Space' Sector (Not Your Average Space Doc, Move Over NASA)

I hope I didn't put off some potential viewers for using the term ""business documentary"". That may sound boring.

Let me assure you, this documentary - basically following three US-based 'new space' start-up companies - isn't boring at all. Some of the main characters in the film are so colorful that you could be fooled into thinking that you watch a fictional movie, not a documentary.

A little bit of background first: Ashlee Vance (also heavily involved and briefly featured in the documentary himself) is a business journalist who wrote a book on new space companies and started filming and interviewing executives as well as academics involved in the space and rocket sectors around the same time.

(I read his book before watching WWS, but this is not a requirement at all. You may even enjoy more surprises watching it without having read his book first - otherwise a few spoilers are obviously revealed in the book already.)

Some readers may be vaguely familiar with Ashlee Vance's name because he was the first to write a biography on Elon Musk - who in turn started one of first private space companies in a Western country (SpaceX).

This documentary and his book only feature SpaceX and other pioneering rocket companies started by fellow billionaires and rivals (Jeff Bezos, Paul Allen, Richard Branson etc.) in passing.

The main focus of WWS are ""normal"" (they are anything but normal in all other aspects, trust me) entrepreneurs. Ambitious people who followed in the foot-steps of these business moguls and tried to (and are still trying to) launch space ventures thanks to third-party funding. It goes without saying that most of these companies require billions of dollars until they maybe have a chance to break even and stand on their own feet. As is repeatedly said or allured to in the film: ""Space is (very) hard"". This is true both in terms of technology and funding.

Speaking of money: Ashlee Vance - having toured the globe visiting space companies in places like New Zealand, French Guiana, Ukraine, Russia and the U. S. - noticed that his funds for the project were running low and started to get outside help to focus/improve the script and finally finish the documentary by 2024.

What was once intended as an entire series was cut into one single documentary. His new partners (experienced in the movie sector, eg. Ross Kauffman with an Academy Award for Best Documentary under his belt) in the project also advised him to focus on just a handful of companies.

WWS therefore follows three space start-ups in detail, namely Astra, Planet Labs and Rocket Lab (with a particular focus on the CEO of each venture).

I think it is a much better movie for it, because there's an emotional attachment for the viewer thanks to this focus. The main characters at each of three companies really spring to life. The completely opposite characters and business approaches of two of the CEOs involved (namely Chris Kemp of Astra and Peter Beck of Rocket Lab) already make the entire documentary worth watching.

The movie offers very detailed and generous insights into all three companies. The filmmakers got access to calls with investors and even the rocket launch sequences inside the mission control rooms - including nerve-wrecking setbacks and failures - as well as the IPOs of all three companies on the public stock market.

From bedrooms and garage operations with tinkerers - to billions in funding, taking over government launchpads and hiring hundreds of employees. A story of rags to riches. And back to zero in some cases (Space is hard...remember).

I can only recall seeing very few business-related documentaries where external observers got such an intimate access over long periods of time (the three companies are covered from about 2016/2017 until early 2024, with older material mixed in from the company archives and other sources).

The documentary reveals how the grip on space and rockets has shifted from national states, bureaucratic organizations (like NASA) and their long-term suppliers (often huge companies like Boeing, Lockheed etc.) to ambitious, nimble and energetic start-ups who skirt or even overstep established rules.

These tectonic shifts will affect all of us in terms of safety, national security and privacy.

Satellite constellations already rule our daily life on Earth right now, for better or worse: From GPS positioning in cars and planes, over emergency calls in remote areas with no conventional cell phone average, to more accurate weather forecasts and troop or refugee movements in or ahead of conflicts across the globe.

The documentary's title is therefore very fitting indeed, the skies have become a Wild Wild Space. Sort of a ""land grab in space"" in the 21st century. Space is now open for business, not just for a few billionaires or very powerful nation states.

The WWS documentary is eye-opening in this regard, we are only at the very beginning. The private space sector today (2024) is maybe at the development stage of the early Internet/WWW era back in 1994 (if I had to take a guess after spending some time on the subject over the last decade).

Rating: 8/10 for ""normal"" viewers. Highly recommended, even for people with no particular or prior interest in the space industry. Even 9/10 for audiences interested in space and rockets.

One of my minor gripes: Space has no boundaries. It would have been great if the documentary also featured a few space start-ups from Asia or Europe, the movie feels a bit U. S.-centric (with the exception of Rocket Lab and its CEO, originating from New Zealand). Maybe a possible sequel can one day move the spotlight to private space and launch efforts on other continents?",

As luck would have it, she's outside a branch of her bank so takes the call inside and quickly identifies a scammer. Rather than report him to the authorities, or shame him on social media, she makes him a proposition. He's not the first to have tried to con this rather naive woman out out of her money. Her ex-boyfriend managed to get ¥200,000 (about £22,000) from her before dumping her. If he can help her get that cash back, she will call it quits. ""Ouyang Hui"" (Sunny Sun) is quite a charming, charismatic young man and despite their mutual mistrust, they spend some time evaluating their pretty-boy mark ""Zhang Zijun"" (Wang Hao) - who has already moved onto to his next vulnerable victim. Their target runs a travel agency and so together with his wily uncle (David Wang) and her actress pal ""Dong Xiaohui"" (Li Xueqin) the pair set about orchestrating a complex sting operation to recoup her money and teach this man a lesson he will never forget. It's quite good fun this, and though maybe a little contrived it allows the engaging Sunny Sun to deliver a mischievous character that, even though fairly venal, proves to be quite a likeable rogue. The quickly paced scenarios are helped along by a cheery score, a few pop songs and, for a change, we don't use a constant stream of mobile phone texts to convey chunks of the dialogue. Of course, there's a burgeoning romance here but with some fun in a Ferrari, a disaster-prone holiday maker and some comedy trust issues, I found it quite an entertainingly daft caper.",7.0

The plot all centres around the wedding banquets of the couples who, bluntly, are marrying the wrong folk!

1127632,Ernest Cole: Lost and Found,"Chronicling the atrocities of social, political and ethnic persecution is undeniably a courageous and important act, especially when informing a largely unaware public of the horrendous events unfolding out of view. However, doing so can also take quite a toll on those recording such incidents, as seen in the graphic depictions captured in their accounts. Such was the case for South African photographer Ernest Cole (1940-1990), who snapped vivid, troubling images of apartheid in his homeland in the early 1960s. In doing so, he took his life in his hands when photographing what was occurring, often having to shoot photos clandestinely and on the run. But Cole nevertheless managed to record candid images of the disturbing treatment Black citizens received at the hands of a brutal, uncaring, insensitive White population, frequently with the complicity of other Africans. Cole eventually fled to the US, to which he was soon exiled by South African authorities for having published House of Bondage (1967), a book of photos depicting the barbarity of the country’s apartheid practices, a title that was subsequently banned in his homeland. Once stateside, though, Cole became disillusioned when he found nearly comparable, legally sanctioned prejudice impacting Blacks in the American South under the region’s Jim Crow Laws. That disillusionment, combined with a profound case of homesickness and the apparent onset of depression, he withdrew from the photographic work that made him famous. Over the next two decades, he moved about aimlessly, including stints in Sweden and elsewhere before returning to the US, gradually falling into obscurity (including the mysterious disappearance of his photographic archives) and becoming homeless on the streets of New York before his death in 1990. Writer-director Raoul Peck documents Cole’s biography through a largely first-person narrative detailing the protagonist’s life and outlooks through what are said to be his own words and photos, a novel approach to presenting his story. And, through the film’s first half, the production succeeds brilliantly at this. However, once past the midpoint, the picture loses its way. The chronological storytelling approach used at the outset is frequently abandoned in favor of a confusingly disjointed timeline. What’s more, Cole’s words at times become redundant, and the specifics behind his artistic withdrawal (and the associated effects of that decision) remain cryptic and unexplained, with many pieces of the puzzle conveniently missing. It’s also mystifying how Cole is somehow able to offer observations of events that took place after his demise, such as the miraculous but inexplicable rediscovery of much of his archive material in a Swedish bank vault in 2017. Regrettably, however, these changes in direction undermine all of the goodwill that the filmmaker worked so diligently to establish at the beginning. These are decidedly perplexing developments, to be sure, as they affect certain aspects of the film that worked well early on, such as its skillful editing, which just doesn’t hold up nearly as well in the back end. To its credit, several elements remain consistently solid throughout, such as the mesmerizing narration of LaKeith Stanfield as the protagonist, the superb original score by Alexei Aigui, and the fine selection of photos and archive footage used for telling Cole’s story. Had this release been put together as well in the second half as it had been in the first, this truly would have been an outstanding documentary. But, as it stands now, this feels like an offering that was only half finished, a regrettable outcome for a compelling story about a gifted, enigmatic figure.",6.0
1117465,Bread & Roses,"When the Taliban resumed control of Afghanistan with its takeover of Kabul in August 2021, virtually all of the progress that had been made in bringing democracy and a more open-minded outlook to the nation was wiped out in a heartbeat. That’s particularly true when it came to the regime’s treatment of women. Despite representing half of the country’s population, women and girls were systematically subjugated to the autocratic rule of the Taliban’s brutal misogynist warlords. Women were forbidden from working, forced to stay at home, and girls’ schools were summarily closed, their hopes of better lives dashed. And those who refused to comply with these dictates were routinely beaten, imprisoned or killed for their actions. This was especially true among the rising tide of activists who fought against these measures. The unbridled tyranny unleashed against these intrepid advocates provides the focus of this insightful and chilling new documentary from director Sahra Mani, providing a personal perspective on what these fiercely determined mavericks have been up against. Their unwillingness to back down, even in the face of severe consequences, is indeed inspiring as they struggle to survive and refuse to go back to the way things once were. It’s an important story that needs to be told, and, from an anecdotal standpoint, the filmmaker does a superb job in depicting the ordeals these women have had to endure. Despite this strength, however, this production could have benefitted from the inclusion of some much-needed background, placing the stories of these heroes in a more relatable, understandable context. That’s especially true given that the personal material – as well presented as it is – tends to become somewhat repetitive as the picture plays out. I fully appreciate the hardships involved in filming a project like this, and the director and crew are to be commended for their daring efforts. However, the overall approach used here comes up a little short in making the impact that it could have made if it had been augmented with content that shines a spotlight on the breadth of the issues at play in this story. The women deserve that. Afghanistan deserves that. And the world needs to know the full extent of what’s going on here if change is ever to come.",7.0
1080512,Pandemonium,"Pandemonium superficially offers a rather classical Christian view of hell and damnation but fails to cash in, on the core premise.

I guess for atheists like myself, it reaffirms why religion offers little appeal. That said, I don't mind a hellish horror tale yet this is really more sad and depressing, than anything else. 

In essence what you get is a ""sort of anthology' that offers up essentially three tales, all of which are rather tragic but ultimately fail to deliver anything of real meaning or interest to the viewer. Aside from re-affirming how awful, life can be.

986355,Girls State,"Now more relevant than ever, “Girls State” is an inspiring documentary that shines a light on the future of American democracy through the eyes of ambitious, intelligent, and passionate young women.

This political coming-of-age film (a companion piece to 2020’s “Boys State”) follows 500 high school girls from Missouri as they gather for a week-long democratic experiment where they create a government from scratch. What emerges is an empowering look at how femininity and leadership intertwine, as these young women demonstrate the drive, intelligence, and ambition needed to shape the world.

The documentary captures a diverse group of teenage girls who are well-spoken and articulate, engaging in meaningful discussions about governance, policy, and the issues that matter most to them. Their passion for politics and their vision for the future are inspiring, offering hope for a generation of leaders ready to tackle the world’s problems head-on. Co-directors Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss take care to center their focus on a handful of participants, allowing an intimate glimpse into how the program transforms these young women.

One of the most interesting aspects here is the documentary’s exploration of the systemic inequalities that emerge between the Girls and Boys State programs, both of which are being hosted on the same campus for the first time. This shared setting naturally invites comparisons between the two, with the program for boys often receiving more attention and being taken more seriously as a venue for meaningful political discourse. The film doesn’t shy away from these disparities, subtly highlighting the gendered expectations that still persist in the world of politics.

What truly stands out is the way these young women embrace the ideas of cooperation and collaboration. Watching them navigate the challenges of building a government from the ground up while forming bonds and sharing their diverse perspectives is quite uplifting. Their willingness to engage with one another, even across ideological divides, offers a refreshing vision of what leadership can look like (and something our country so desperately needs at the moment).

“Girls State” is a well-made documentary that celebrates the potential of young women to change the world. It’s a film that leaves you hopeful for the future, as these teenage girls exhibit the determination and vision to reach extraordinary heights. They are, without a doubt, the future leaders we need.

716309,Kill,"When one young man has a stag firmly in his sights, he balks at the idea of killing it and incurs the wrath of an older man that results in a scuffle that sees another of their party shooting the bloke who turns out to be their rather brutish dad (Paul Higgins). What's equally clear very quickly is that ""John"" (Brian Vernel) and siblings ""Henry"" (Daniel Portman) and ""Vince"" (Calum Ross) had a masterplan that day that was designed to put their nemesis in the ground. What now occurs fills in, by way of flashback, just what drove these young men to their rather drastic course of action whilst we also discover than pops isn't that easy to do away with. With tensions now mounting amidst the dense Caledonian forest, the brothers start to mistrust each other and with tempers flaring they start to wonder who is trustworthy amongst them. Although the story is different, it reminded me a little bit of ""Mercy Falls"" also from 2023, that over-used the drone footage of ancient woodlands and menacing audio to substitute for some fairly bland writing and acting and a, frankly, increasingly preposterous and protracted storyline that presented us with three principal characters about whom I didn't care at all. It does try to use it's environment to create peril but once the jigsaw (I'd say a six-piece one) of the story was in place then I really did start to lose interest in what became a rather angrily procedural drama devoid of anything at all new or characterful. As a Scot, it's important that we continue to invest in domestic film-making, but endless aerials of fir trees do not, as ""Yoda"" might have said, a decent film make.",6.0

He's always laughing at everyone's jokes no matter how unfunny they are, and he even cracks up at his own material, finding himself absolutely hilarious like some sycophantic yes-man, but his comedy stylings work in a scripted space where his inevitable laughter was likely cut out.

1232422,Verbrannte Erde,"**Shadowrun**!

The film promotion probably needed a mention of Nouvelle Vague; and I too quickly thought of Melville's classics.

But even if the previous film hadn't been called ‘In the Shadows’:

This is Shadowrun.
Without magic, metahumans, and in the Germany of 202x - but otherwise a street-level Shadowrun.
A solo, a fixer, a job; a rigger, a decker, a samurai about to retire; a Schmidt¹... and the run.

After the introduction of the characters - Trojan gets the longest, the others progressively shorter - the run gets underway in classic Shadowrun fashion.

The sober realism is very pleasing. Even German ÖRR crime thrillers today have a slight superhero halo around the characters. Here, on the other hand, the production conveys: this is real street level, Chummer; a single shot can kill you.

And that heightens the suspense. 

Which is necessary, because the sober, gritty, auteur film look of ‘Scorched Earth’ flattens all action film expectations. The rigger drives well, Trojan drives often, but real cars in real world physics. Weapons are used, things are hacked and faked - but only as they probably could be in real life.

In terms of acting, almost everyone is fully involved and effective in their performance, intensity adapted to the focus of the respective role, good casting right down to the supporting roles.
Only Bilge Bingül shows that he is not a professional actor; his performance would have worked in a comedy, here it was a little distracting. But not excessively.


If you go in expecting an action film, you will be disappointed; if you expect a noir film, you will be well served.
And if you can imagine the combination of Novuelle Vague and Shadowrun: this is it.


I liked it a lot. For my taste, it's worth seeing and recommending, but not for the general public.

1150399,Skeletons in the Closet,"Misleading plot summary. This is actually more of a supernatural ghost story than a possession movie. With that said, there aren't any jumpscares like in most movies about a ghost haunting. 

It is generally a very sad and emotional film about a family that felt they had no choice in order to cure their daughter. The ending almost had me in tears. They kind of hinted at a possible sequel. 

The performance from the cast very good actually because it takes a good dramatic actor in order to pull of a lot of the scenes. Kudos to the lead actress! Terrance Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr are in this film. I was surprised to see Cuba in this sort of film. He does good though.


I rather enjoyed watching this movie even though it wasn't actually scary. It was more of a ghost haunting and mystery with some thrills mixed in.

I give this supernatural horror movie a 2/5 stars.",
1214558,Power,"Questions about unchecked police power have become one of today’s hot button social issues, and the public is deeply divided about it, depending on who one speaks with. Writer-director Yance Ford’s latest pours ample fuel onto this fire with a cinematic essay that clearly has an impassioned view on the subject, making a strong case that some will obviously agree with but that others are likely to decry as an agenda-driven leftist treatise. Through a series of interviews with academics who have studied the issue and criminal justice insiders, viewers are shown the dual-edged sword surrounding this subject. While the film acknowledges that there is a need for policing in light of the prevalence of violent crime, it also argues that the supposed deterrent to this problem – a greater police presence with wider, legally sanctioned latitude in carrying out its mission – is simultaneously contributing to its growth, circumstances that have long gone unrecognized and/or willfully ignored as a result of longstanding prejudicial societal conditions that have only furthered the proliferation of this issue. Those conditions, in turn, are dissected in terms of how and why they fell into place through the years as a means to curtail the freedoms of those who were seen as posing an inherent (if somewhat overblown and paranoic) threat to the social order imposed by an entitled power structure (namely, anyone whose demographic attributes didn’t match those of the self-appointed elite). Archive footage thus explores the efforts of early police forces to contain the lives and activities of slaves, indigenous peoples, immigrants and labor organizers, all of whom were considered suspect simply by virtue of their own innate identities. And, from these dubiously sanctioned roots, the power of those in charge has only grown more formidable and pervasive in forcefully holding down those who are perceived as dangers to the status quo, such as student radicals, social and political opponents, and others outside “the mainstream,” thanks to the supply of increasingly alarming means more typical of paramilitary operations than the civilized maintenance of law and order necessary for the functioning of a supposedly mature democracy. Good cases are made in favor of these arguments, to be sure. And, in all fairness, the film incorporates the views of constituents within the system who are legitimately trying to reform it internally. Admittedly, though, “Power” has a tendency to become somewhat circular in making its point, redundantly repeating its genuinely valid contentions but without offering solutions to a scenario that only seems to growing worse without impactful efforts to contain it, a decidedly missed opportunity to meaningfully address the situation. Perhaps that’s what is needed next, with this offering serving primarily to draw attention to and raise awareness of the issue, but I think the public at large is already sufficiently cognizant of the situation that this release could have gone farther in tackling its subject. Sustained recognition of the problem is certainly a noteworthy takeaway from this production, but it’s unfortunate that it didn’t seek to expand on that notion and offer us more in terms of providing answers – and hope for the future.",6.0

1129123,High & Low – John Galliano,"I think Kevin Macdonald has tread a fine line quite carefully here as he uses a candid interview with John Galliano as the bedrock for a retrospective on the career of this enigmatic and undoubtedly flawed individual. From his graduation from St. Martin's College in London through to his ill-fated custodianship of Haute Couture at Dior, we follow this man on a warts and all documentary that is substantially supported by some seriously good archive research and some equally frank contributions from friends and foes alike. As someone put it in the narrative, some of his fashions did beg the questions ""who for?"" and ""where?"" and that is part of what makes this interesting. The association behind the more obscure of his high end fashion (especially his Egyptian-inspired designs that even Elizabeth Taylor might struggle with) through to the more scantily clad and ambiguous creations with that worn by the ordinary person shopping on the high street is always a curiously, obliquely, tangential one! The film tells us about the man, certainly, but also about the vagaries of an industry that pushes, drives, rewards and punishes in equal measure. What is clear from early on here is that Galliano became addicted to almost everything - from the varied contents of a bottle, or to a pencil and a pair of scissors, or just to the lucrative adulation that created a ""Hyde"" at times from his original ""Jekyll"". The fact that he clearly has little actual memory of the incident in the Café de la Perle that brought about his downfall is testament to his complete lack of self awareness and control by this point in his career. Burning the candle at both ends and in the middle would, I suspect, turn most of us into mush. Macdonald doesn't attempt to coax us in any given direction regarding our reaction to this incident, and to the fall out. Galliano has his opponents and his proponents. We are presented with as much fact as there is, plenty of prognostication - and left to conclude just how evil (or not) he is/was/may still be. It also gives us a chance to look in the mirror and ask ourselves where forgiveness may lie... It's entertaining at times, and the pictorial documentation of his career and that of many of his contemporaries is a must watch for anyone interested in the development of, and fascination in, this industry.",7.0
1126475,Arthur's Whisky,"Super dumb, yet it somehow kinda worked for me.

<em>'Arthur’s Whisky'</em> is a very low budget picture, I mean just look at that unintentionally hilarious attempt at portraying a visit to Las Vegas (!!). The plot is very silly and, obviously, nonsensical but in the end I kinda dug it, to be honest. The film does plateau at around the hour mark, though the heartfelt conclusion brought it back to win me over.

I guessed the general vibe (slow paced story of oldies being oldies) of this movie based on the poster and I was mostly correct, though the opening minutes of this made it look like a proper adventure/fantasy was on the way - it evidently wasn't, so quite the jarring beginning!

Diane Keaton, Patricia Hodge and Lulu lead onscreen events and the trio do well enough, as a three they worked better than they did individually. What actually probably helped this for me was the three that played their youngers. Genevieve Gaunt, Esme Lonsdale and Hannah Howland are good. Adil Ray's whole subplot with Lulu/Howland is very cringe, mind you.

1062526,El eco,"There is something of the time capsule to this documentary of a small village in Mexico. Nothing here has changed for centuries as the younger generations tend the sheep flocks and the elderly whilst nature presents them with some challenges that test not just their faith in themselves but their desires to stay and live this subsistence life. Some don’t, and move to the big city where electricity, running water, food and jobs are far more plentiful. There is a scene with an elderly lady walking up a steep hill carrying two buckets of water on a pole across her shoulders that did make me hope that she didn’t have to retake that shot too often, and indeed there are plenty of authentic images as these villagers grapple with everything from the ageing process to drought. For the most part, we take our view from the youngsters of this community and that offers us something freshly optimistic and tangibly realistic - and the filming provides us with an observation, amidst some beautiful and pristine scenery, of a lifestyle that probably faces it’s most formidable of obstacles despite their enthusiasm and stoicism.

Perhaps the productions only real saving grace is excellent CGI and a intriguing vision of the future with the wealthy living off planet, on luxurious space stations. Acting is alright too but the whole tone of this thing doesn't, I believe, provide enough room for inspired performances.

1208994,Ukjent landskap,"I was initially quite apprehensive when I saw the start of this introduce me to a family of Scandinavian tree huggers - quite literally! Quite swiftly, though, I was disabused of that rather twee notion as we meet Nik Payne and his three young children. They live in a modern-looking home on a small-holding in Norway where all are dealing with the recent death of wife and mother Maria. She already had a daughter, Ronja, who also features as they all have to come to terms with their grief as well as more tangible issues. Those latter problems are going to force them to relocate and also to cease with their practice of home-schooling. That’s because Nik is going to have to go to work to support them. Of course the youngsters are anxious about starting school some years after their contemporaries and their dad is equally nervous about how they will fit in and also about how he will cope as they start to branch out a little more independently. These concerns come to a bit of an head when elder daughter Freya finds much of her schooling requires an iPad - and these are folks who don’t even possess a telly. With the children increasingly preoccupied with their new routine and with some new friends, Nik starts to have to deal with his own feelings of loneliness as he considers whether or not they might be better if all returned to his British rural homeland. There are no easy answers for any of them here but they share a solid and strong bond that offers an optimism and hope that as they all grow up, they will benefit from having been raised to appreciate and respect each other and the natural environment in which they thrive. It is interesting just how quickly they all got used to the camera on their shoulder. The photography gets up close and very personal as Nik has to deal with a myriad of issues and yet remain positive and supportive, and with Freya and Ronja as they both have to come to terms with the absence of their mother in their own way - without, they hope, alienating the other. There is something a bit unrealistic, flawed even, about the parameters in which this family approached life. You have to ask whether the policy of keeping the kids at home all day was naive and self-indulgent on the parents’ part or was it, as they declare, to avoid them having to fit in with societal rules and norms? To be “liberated”. As the children first go to school and have to learn new social skills long since mastered by their fellow pupils and especially when technology starts to darken their door, you do wonder if perhaps the original parental aspirations weren’t just a little bit short-sighted and selfish. I didn’t always love the fly-on-the-wall approach. At times it felt positively prurient to observe moments that most definitely didn’t need an audience, but for the most part this is quite an engaging look at loving people having to navigate a series of crossroads and advance, often quite gingerly, to the next stages of their lives. There is one scene that the squeamish amongst us might not like, but it is otherwise a remarkably human story that’s worth a watch.

It did not disappoint. The story was fun and ominous, the characters all had distinct voices and characteristics, and the visuals were so reminiscent of the 80s and 90s movies like The Craft and Jumanji. I wish we could have seen more of the *WILL NOT SPOIL WHAT* that happens in the movie, but overall this is a solid indie horror film made on a tiny budget! Bravo!!",8.0
1174200,Stupid Games,"Co-directors Nicolas Wendl and Dani Abraham put forth a ton of effort with their indie horror film “Stupid Games,” a solid genre entry that has a decent story, relatable characters, and a hook that’s both classic and fresh. This isn’t a slick and highly polished movie by any means, but the charmingly amateurish performances from the cast and a setup that feels familiar make this homegrown horror comfortable and fun. 

Jaxon (Saad Rolando) and Rex (Gage Robinson) are two bros with a primary objective: getting laid. Jaxon is excited that his dream of a one night stand is really going to happen when his friend Celeste (Alyssa Tortomasi) invites the guys over for drinks, dinner, and game night. She’s asked her best friends Riley (Cass Huckabay) and Mia (Ashwini Ganpule) to join, but the boys get a lot more than they bargained for when the group unknowingly unleash a malevolent force that’s thirsty for blood.

It’s a simple idea for a movie, but Wendl and Abraham keep things interesting. It takes over an hour for the suspense and horror to finally kick in, with exposition and character development making up the majority of the film’s run time. The dialogue is natural and unforced, setting the stage for the film’s darker final act, with escalating tension and a shift towards the ominous. It requires some patience as the directors lay the groundwork, but it’s worth sticking it out because the ending is oh-so-satisfying.

“Stupid Games” is an enjoyable watch because the storytelling is done so well. If you’re a fan of the genre and appreciate the quirks of indie horror, this one is definitely worth your time.

Let’s just say the place is unused to the dynamism of this young man whose artistic flair and sexually-charged movement starts off gently but builds to something that really rocks the boat - and largely within the confines of a cubicle in a public toilet that doubles up as a cottage from time to time too. As the music reaches it’s crescendo the crowds pack into this rapidly TARDIS-esque space and the effects of his performance become contagious as those previously content to view begin to take part - and a rather creatively filmed sort of orgy takes over the town with three guys having sex between the tins of corned beef in the supermarket. It’s a film about empowerment and freedom and it has a certain breeziness to the conclusion that works quite well, too.

1287819,侍タイムスリッパー,"<em>'A Samurai in Time'</em> is truly splendid. I wouldn't actually describe it as anything super enthralling or anything, but it is supremely watchable, fairly amusing and surprisingly hearty - the 120+ minute run time flew by. I'd happily revisit this one.

The performances of Makiya Yamaguchi and Norimasa Fuke are of real quality, both individually and as a collective. I totally believed and bought into the trajectory of the characters, which is impressive as otherwise they've could've been quite plain 'fish out of water' types.

Yuno Sakura (cool to read about her backstory for this, same can be said for the film as a whole in fact), Rantaro Mine and Tsutomu Tamura manage to stick out behind the main two, as do a few other of the more minimal roles in this; e.g. Manko Kurenai’s.

It does lean on the out of place trope, but I don't mean that negatively whatsoever because they add their own thing to keep it feeling fresh. As the minutes tick by, it relies less and less on that and the, relatively more unique, conclusion is the film at its best in my opinion.

1214557,Luther: Never Too Much,"Using a wide array of archive and some fairly honest and potent interviews, this documentary presents us with a short biopic of rather an enigmatic gent. Initially, his dulcet tones earned him a decent enough living doing lucrative commercials and providing backing vocals until a session with David Bowie started his career on a largely unhindered upwards trajectory. His associations with Aretha Franklin, Bette Midler and Roberta Flack, his total - almost perfectionist - commitment to his art and his cheeky sense of humour all contributed further to a success that transcended not just US racial boundaries, but also physical international ones too. I wasn't really that aware of his music, but watching this does effectively illustrate just how many songs he was behind - writing and/or performing, that are more familiar than I'd expected. This also wasn't a messy man. He wasn't in and out of the papers with stories of his life, his lifestyle, his drinking or drug taking - he actually comes across as a remarkably stable man in many ways, even if his solution to problems he faced was to reach for the fried chicken bucket or the ice cream spoon. Happily, we don't really focus too much on the personal life. Perhaps because his own comments of ""mind your own **** business"" are echoed by the film's contributors who knew him and who chose not to add fuel to any fires burning about his sexuality. It's a celebration of his music that broadens awareness for folk like me who didn't realise the scope of his skills, and it is a fitting and spangly tribute for those who did.",7.0

Its a shame too, as the core premise has real scare potential. Moreover, its production values are reasonable, as are the performances, from the cast.

1190836,The G,"From the look of the posters, this ought to be a film about a Polish gangster! Instead, it's about the curmudgeonly, vodka-swilling, ""Ann"" (Dale Dickey). It's really only her grand-daughter ""Emma"" (Romane Denis) who takes any interest in her as she goes through life with her incapacitated husband ""Chip"". Asleep one night, their home is invaded by people armed with a court order that puts them into a legally binding guardianship arrangement. This basically says that they are incapable of managing their own affairs and have to have someone else take control. Nobody asked anyone to do this, nor did the couple know of the court proceedings supporting it. It was all down to a dodgy doctor on the payroll of ""Rivera"" (Bruce Ramsay) who had his eye on their condo and their savings. Now locked inside their new apartment, she is determined to get out - especially as their new hosts can prove quite violent when it comes to making sure that they have squeezed out every penny the couple have. What ""Rivera"" doesn't count on, though, is that ""G"" has a bit of an history when it comes to looking after herself. What follows next is all a bit procedural and though Dickey is clearly having some bad-ass fun, the main thrust of the story is really the outrageous scenario that it represents: that some states in the US allow people to be summarily removed from their homes, and from control of their assets, by anonymous third parties fuelled by greed and palm-greasing. It's worth a watch, but the television will do fine.",6.0
1190836,The G,"Good film.  Here's what the Fantasia Film Festival says about it:  After decades as a character actor in countless films and TV series (winning numerous awards in the process), Dale Dickey takes centre stage in THE G, delivering a performance fierce and flinty enough to give Eastwood or Bronson pause (and certainly more subtle than either). Like Dickey’s turn as Ann, Montreal director Karl R. Hearne’s second feature film, a favourite on the festival circuit, bristles with quiet, carefully calibrated intensity. Inspired by his own grandmother, apparently one tough cookie, as well as outrage at the frequency of elder abuse right under our noses, Hearne has crafted a gritty revenge thriller laced with shards of bitter humour and anchored by an unconventional yet entirely convincing protagonist—a different shade of noir, with a touch of grey. – Rupert Bottenberg",9.0
1125953,13 Sentimentos,"Getting back in the dating scene after a long absence can be quite a challenge. With ever-changing conventions dictating what’s acceptable and what’s not these days, those who are out of practice can be left bewildered (especially those who were never particularly adept at modern-day courting to begin with). That’s very much the case with João (Artur Volpi), who just broke up with his partner of 10 years. He’s a nice guy, if a bit reserved and geeky, but certainly quite handsome and politely genial. Yet, even though he’s certainly open to getting back into the dating game, the ambitious Brazilian filmmaker is actually most anxious to begin work on directing a new arthouse movie from his own script. However, just as the production is about to launch, his funding gets pulled, forcing him to retool the screenplay for a potential new would-be backer. But, as he’s doing this, he develops writer’s block, unsure what kind of story he wants to tell. So, to occupy his time as he sorts out this issue, he investigates new dating opportunities, many of which prove to be more boldly “amorously assertive” than he’s accustomed to, revealing just how much he’s out of touch with current dating practices than he realized. In fact, when “hopeful” suitors discover that he makes movies, they suggestively approach him to put his talents to use for chronicling their erotic escapades – not with him but with other more willing participants. So, with no income in hand and in need of money, João relents, taking his filmmaking work in a decidedly different (and personally embarrassing) new direction. But this path gets him no closer to career or romantic fulfillment. So what’s he to do now? That’s what he needs to find out for himself. However, as promising as this premise might sound for a gay romcom/outrageous sex farce, writer-director Daniel Ribeiro seriously drops the ball by committing the cardinal sin of moviemaking in this genre – creating a picture that’s tediously dull. As this offering unfolds, it fails to generate giggles in either of the protagonist’s hapless undertakings, areas that should be rife with potential for yielding sidesplitting laughs. What’s more, for a movie that’s supposed to be heavy on eroticism, this release contains some of the most boring on-screen sex I’ve ever seen (explicit though some of it may be). And the picture’s lame attempts at incorporating supposedly creative narrative twists and more serious subject matter largely fall even flatter than its other failed material. The result is a finished product that fails to take advantage of the innate strengths it should have had going for it. It’s little more than a tiresome, uninteresting slog that seems far longer than its 1:40:00 runtime – and a seriously missed opportunity to make what easily could have been an admittedly cheeky but nevertheless uproariously funny comedy. So much for the perfect endings.",1.0
1026821,大雨,"Now I will readily admit that for a fair amount of this, I wasn't quite sure what was going on... The young ""Mantou"" has been adopted and cared for for many years by ""Daguzi"" (or ""Biggie"") but the arrival of a big wooden submarine-type ship spells disaster for all as the ""jellieels"" have taken over this vessel and if they come in contact with human beings - via their sort of flying umbrella bodies - then they will convert you into one of them too. If they can spread themselves widely enough, then they will be able to use the impending cloudburst to create a new king and he will rule the world. What's to stop them? The King has sent troops armed with guns under the command of his daughter and accompanied by her brother who is obsessed with finding the sacred satin cloth of their only potential ally in this conflict - a race of tribesmen who vaguely resembled ants. Anyway, as the denouement looms and the great storm that could facilitate the birth of the king starts it's steady stream of rain, we have to hope that all can put past differences aside and that the magic of the ""fairy brother"" and their combined efforts can thwart this Cronos-style reincarnation. There appears to be quite a bit of textual information on screen - beautifully calligraphic - at the start that tells us a little of the myth and source of the legends played out here. Without knowing what any of that said, I was in the dark a bit and had to make some guesses about who was whom and what was going on. That said, the animation is active and competent enough at filling in enough of the characterisation gaps thereby making the story quite enjoyable if just a bit confusing. Perhaps another viewing might improve things, but maybe this is just a jigsaw best left with - for the English speaker - bits missing?",6.0
951022,Copa 71,"It's quite interesting that even now, there are those amongst the footballing establishment who dismiss this competition as little better than an unsanctioned exhibition event of no consequence whatsoever. If you watch it, however, you can't help but get a sense of the pride with which the women from six teams assembled in Mexico to play. James Erskine et al has done a quite an effective job tracking down many of the players who took part and at finding some grainy, but perfectly watchable, archive of the games and of the celebratory nature of the hosting country back in 1971. The narrative and commentaries take a pretty firm swipe at the men-only culture that prevailed in the sport - and amongst most of their advising medical professionals - which limited women's participation in the sport and though the film make precisely no attempt to balance it's clear objective with any counter-arguments about the perceived dangers to women players, or feature any interviews with anyone from FIFA or UEFA regarding their decision making rationale, this still makes for quite a powerful depiction of just how inclusive football, as a sport, can be.

901059,City of Dreams,"#MovieReview #CityOfDreams #CityOfDreamsFilm #CityOfDreamsMovie 

Let me begin by sharing that my review of the movie ""City of Dreams"" might contain spoilers, not because I want to ruin the experience for you, but because this film impacted me so deeply that I was physically affected while watching it. Tears streamed down my face, and I felt nauseous throughout the entire movie.

The storyline follows Jesus, a 15-year-old boy who is sold into modern slavery to work in a factory in the United States, where he is subjected to trafficking, labor exploitation, and sexual abuse. Witnessing his journey of being beaten, slashed, and punched without speaking a word throughout the film is heart-wrenching. The actor, Ari Lopez, portrays this role with such intensity and skill that it is truly commendable.

This film gripped me so tightly that I found myself wanting to reach out and protect Jesus from the horrors he endured. Despite knowing it was just a movie, I couldn't help but feel a strong emotional connection to the character. The content may be disturbing, but the movie itself, including the acting and storytelling, is exceptional and ranks among the best I have seen.

Watching two impactful films in one day, both centered around different interpretations of Jesus, left me in awe of the power of cinema. These were movies I initially overlooked but am grateful I gave them a chance. ""City of Dreams"" takes viewers on an intense emotional journey, prompting reflection on the harsh realities faced by vulnerable individuals like Jesus.

The film sheds light on the atrocities of child and human trafficking, highlighting the importance of standing up against such injustices. It's a stark reminder that abuse and exploitation have no place in society, and it is our duty to protect those who are vulnerable.

If you are sensitive to heavy themes or graphic content, ""City of Dreams"" may not be suitable for you unless you have someone to share the emotional weight with. Personally, I don't think I could watch it again alone due to its intense nature, but I recognize the value of experiencing it with a supportive group.",10.0
378160,Abruptio,"I am not speaking in absolutes when I say I have never seen anything as disquieting and disturbing as “Abruptio,” a nightmarish project from writer-director Evan Marlowe. Watching this macabre horror film was a traumatic experience, and it’s still haunting me days later. It’s unlike anything you’ve ever seen, and telling the grim story with incredibly lifelike puppetry is an amazing achievement that will leave your jaw on the floor.

The film tells the story of 35-year-old Les Hackel (James Marsters), a guy who is down on his luck. He works a meaningless and dull job, was recently dumped by his girlfriend, attends group therapy sessions, and still lives with his displeased parents, who seem to take every opportunity to criticize his life choices. Basically, his life sucks. One day, Les wakes up to find an explosive device has been implanted in his neck. He must carry out increasingly heinous crimes in order to stay alive, all while trying to identify the mysterious mastermind manipulating him and others around him.

This horror film is made entirely with life-sized puppets in live action settings. Yes, puppets. xxx has created a chilling, fully realized, bizarre world with equally disturbing characters that inhabit it. The puppetry is unbelievably detailed, so much so that you quickly forget that you aren’t watching human actors. The diverse voice talent (featuring Jordan Peele, Hana Mae Lee, Robert Englund, Christopher McDonald, and the late Sid Haig) is a splendid match for the material.

The movie highlights a series of savage and horrific acts of violence. Don’t be fooled into thinking this is kid stuff: the film is filled with psychopaths, bloody gore, and unrelenting brutality. You wouldn’t think all of this bloodshed would get to you because it’s carried out by puppets, but some of the scenes are so tense and stomach-churning that they are still causing me distress. It’s the stuff of nightmares.

This isn’t just another horror movie, however. There’s a great deal of thematic depth here, with multiple layers of meaning. It’s a story about corporate control and the willingness of society to capitulate to their demands. It’s a metaphor for how we are all just being manipulated by those more powerful than us, a willing battalion for the faceless puppet masters who hold the strings. It’s a look at America’s mental health crisis. It’s a story about a man who is confused and needs affection. It’s a tale of trauma, masculinity, and growing up. There is so much to unpack here, the film begs for repeat viewings.

The story loses focus and gets weirder as it goes on, but the first half is just fantastic. “Abruptio” is a remarkably creative work of horror that ushers in a refreshing burst of ingenuity to the genre.",7.0

1233269,Reawakening,"This had the makings of quite compelling drama dealing with loss, grief and longing but somehow the practical elements of the story as it played out didn't work for me. ""John"" (Jared Harris) and wife ""Mary"" (Juliet Stevenson) and happily enough married but it soon becomes clear that their daughter ""Clare"" got caught up with a bad-influence boyfriend and ran away from home some the years ago. The police suggest a revitalised campaign to support the impending anniversary of her disappearance and next thing there's a girl in their kitchen (Erin Doherty) armed with plenty of quite intimate knowledge of this couple and asserting that she's the long lost ""Clare"". ""Mary"" oozes a sort of maternal desperation to believe and welcomes her pretty unconditionally. ""John"", on the other hand, is much more sceptical and as the story unfolds this puts quite a strain on their relationship. Now the father does insist on some sort of DNA test, but not realistically - for my money - emphatically enough. He has significant doubts yet the plot allows her to take advantage of the vulnerable mother without his much more robust interventions to prove one way or the other. I know such scenarios can never black and white, but given the police are continuing to investigate - and coming up with leads that could prove/disprove the identity of their new child, I felt the story took just a little too contrived a direction and at times might be considered a bit cruel. Auteur Virgina Gilbert has dialled down the hysteria nicely and for such an emotive subject, she guides these two characters without too much histrionics and tantrums, but I just felt the thrust of the second half of the thing a touch too implausible from a man who must have loved and felt responsible for his wife as much as for a girl he hadn't seen in a decade. Stevenson is good in these down-to-earth roles, gels quite well with Harris and the film is worth a gander, but it's a bit unrealistic.",6.0
1218032,Super Charlie,"Despite being about fifty years older than it’s demographic, I actually quite enjoyed this. Every century, a meteorite endowed with super-powers flies path the earth, and the only very recently born “Charlie” somehow manages to absorb it’s green dust. Nothing is too obvious when he goes home with his writer mother, who is constantly glued to her laptop; his policeman father and his elder brother “Wille”. Of course, there is soon a degree of little brother envy as these parents dote on their new arrival, but it is his sibling who discovers that at barely a week old, “Charlie” can talk! That’s just the beginning of his quirks, and so soon the pair are on the trail of a gang who have caused their father considerable trouble over the years. All the while, the police are under pressure to buy some specially adapted uniforms that could make them into “Robocop” types, but fairly quickly we learn that the evil “Imperio” is up to a bit of sophisticated manipulation whilst it’s moustachioed sidekick cunningly devises a pint-sized chair to essentially percolate the formidable powers of the young babe, so he can make himself an ultra-potent espresso. The story follows a predictable path, but along the way it does make a few salient points about obsessed parents, brotherly rivalry and mistrust whilst also proving that, in the end, family ought to come first. It’s not really a film for young kids as some of the dialogue is a bit tongue-in-cheek, but the visual effects are quite good fun and the message it wishes to convey to children and parents alike are adequately wrapped up in a light-hearted, sci-fi, amiability that sees the two lads learn to communicate with each other without the need for a phone, or a tablet, or any form of social media at all. That’s got to be a good thing.",6.0
1205834,言えない秘密,"Secret: A Hidden Score reinvents the 2007 original with a fresh perspective and new plot twists, delivering a heartfelt story from the female lead’s point of view. While it diverges significantly in character backgrounds and tones down the iconic piano performances, the film preserves key emotional moments and builds strong chemistry among the cast. Overall, it stands on its own as a touching Japanese romance that’s worth a re-watch despite differences from the original.

The story of course was very dark and the location was wonderful for the story. The acting was ok but I was surprised with the ending but not in a bad way. The approach of Goldilocks teaming up with the bears was a smart idea and it works really well. Violent but a cool new horror version.,7.0
1172097,That They May Face the Rising Sun,"A moving picture!

I pretty much went into the cinema with <em>'That They May Face the Rising Sun'</em> totally blind in terms of what to expect, just the way I like it mind you. All I knew was that it was outta Ireland and based on a book, which I evidently hadn't heard of. I'm pleased to say what greeted my eyes was a very splended movie.

The story is simple, one that holds no bells and whistles. I don't mean that in a negative way whatsoever, as it is the film's greatest element. It's all very grounded, which allows the acting talent to shine. Though, the cinematography is exquisite. It is also paced to perfection, in that regard I was kinda caught off guard when the credits appeared!

Barry Ward and Anna Bederke are the cover stars and are worthy in their roles of Joe and Kate, I enjoyed them both. However, those behind them are the standouts for me. Lalor Roddy is fantastic as Patrick, so much emotion (and humour!) delivered from him throughout. Brendan Conroy does a lot with relatively little, similarly (first time actor, so I read?!) Phillip Dolan and Sean McGinley (esp. at the end).

It's all extremely touching. Safe to say, I'd highly recommend this!",9.0
1172097,That They May Face the Rising Sun,"There's something very potent about the Celtic habit of understating things. A few choice words, a bit of sarcasm or invocation of nature or, occasionally, religion coupled with some perfectly judged facial expressions or shrugs! It can be used to really good comic effect and to illustrate entertainingly just how folks live their lives and deal with death. ""Joe"" (Barry Ward) and wife ""Kate"" (Anna Bederke) live in their rural home where he is trying to put together his latest book and she juggles her time between running a gallery in London and living the dream amidst a remarkably dry Ireland. The film essentially plonks us in their home for a few days as we watch a variety of local souls pop in for tea, whiskey and chat. What's quite striking about this community is the lack of the young. Everyone here is nearer the end than the beginning, and with the vacillating character of ""Patrick"" (Lalor Roddy), the returning from Britain ""Johnny"" (Sean McKinley), his brother ""Jamesie"" (Phillip Dolan) and the curmudgeon that is ""Bill"" (Brendan Conroy) making up the characterful sextuplet of regulars we are presented with a glimpse at a perfectly plausible day in the life sort of thing... The ""Patrick"" character is probably the most interesting, flawed and decent, angry yet caring; but the others all fit into this sympathetically filmed jigsaw puzzle of what goes around comes around nicely. Don't expect lots to actually happen, but do expect to smile quite a bit and think a little, too.",7.0
1172097,That They May Face the Rising Sun,"Pat Collins’ first narrative film largely, refreshingly, lacks a conventional narrative. Adapted from John McGahern’s final novel, it reveals the director’s considerable skill with both sight and sound, a fine cast, and a surprisingly explicit wink to Ozu.

Collins lovingly frames a hallowed rural Irish community of a half-century ago, whose religion and traditions provide order, and hope, but are nevertheless already significantly hollowed out. Indeed, for all of the film’s prose-tinted passion, it has an unmistakably funereal feel. Its people, and those like them, are buried in their stony grey soil, the bones on which today’s Ireland are built.

1036641,High Tide,"Relishing the freedom to openly be oneself can be a fulfilling and liberating experience, especially for those who have lived most of their lives hiding from disapproving family members and a close-minded society. So it is for Lourenço (Marco Pigossi), a Brazilian transplant seeking to resettle permanently in Provincetown, MA, a goal dependent on him acquiring a work visa to replace a tourist visa that’s about to expire. He has an added incentive to fulfill that objective when he meets and falls for Maurice (James Bland), a vacationer from New York who’s visiting the oceanside resort town before embarking on an ambitious, long-term nursing residency in the wilds of Angola. But can the two would-be lovers make this relationship work in light of the impending changes in their respective lives, geography and careers? What’s more, as this budding romance begins to blossom, Lourenço also wrestles with leftover baggage from an old relationship, unwanted advances from opportunistic lecherous would-be suitors and never-ending pressure from his mother back in Brazil, who is unaware of his closeted sexuality and routinely prods him to settle down and find a wife. While writer-director Marco Calvani capably and sensitively presents a tender, authentic, same-sex love story, the picture nevertheless tells a somewhat familiar tale whose narrative is not particularly original in the annals of LGBTQ+ cinema. It also struggles to blend its own brands of comedy and drama, both of which are handled well in their own right but whose inherent natures frequently come across as too extremely opposed to one another to harmonize in a believable, coherent whole. On top of that, the film also tries to cover too much ground at times, with a number of subplots that could have been easily trimmed or eliminated entirely without causing any undue harm to the picture overall. To its credit, though, this offering sincerely has its heart in the right place, despite the aforementioned shortcomings, backed up by an array of fine supporting performances and gorgeous cinematography showcasing the beauty and character of this charming Cape Cod resort town. Unfortunately, however, “High Tide” is yet another recent release that could have used some significant retooling to help it fully live up to its potential, especially given its predominantly conventional premise. Gay cinema has increasingly been moving forward in new and innovative directions in recent years, so, if filmmakers in this genre attempt to tackle new expressions of tried-and-true formulas like this, they had better have a good grasp of what they’re doing if they ultimately hope to succeed in the end.",6.0
1026468,Scala!!!,"This is quite a fascinating documentary following the fate of a cinema that even John Waters said ""shocked him"". It wasn't always on the same site in Central London, but the ""Scala"" name quickly became a magnet for all those who didn't conform to the more mainstream - with their own behaviour and/or attitudes and/or taste in films. Using an astonishing amount of well researched actuality and some interviews with the folks who worked there or attended over the years, we learn of a place that offered a venue for any combination of the Bohemian, the decadent, the drugged up, boozed up, gay - and, yep, even the serious film goer as it originally opened and closed many years later with ""King Kong"" (1933)! I did live in London in the late 1980s and King's Cross was a dump - full of hookers, rent boys and you never strayed far from an heroin needle. The ""Scala"" thrived amidst this alternative and hedonistic environment and though I don't know that I quite qualify for the groups that regularly used the place after midnight, my two visits were fun and never intimidating - the sound system there was not the best! Porn, horror, martial arts, cartoons - nothing was off limits until the local council took exception to ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) and the subsequent legal fracas pretty much put paid to the place as a cinema. It's split into parts that illustrate the rise and fall of what was essentially an establishment that didn't really matter in which building it was located. Sticky floors, sticky seats, dark ""back massages"" offering a range of facilities from a sleeping berth to a shagging one. It can't resist the usual bit of Mrs. Thatcher-bashing at the end which adds a bit of authenticity to a cinema that existed precisely because it was so anti-establishment and pro free-spirit. It reminded me a little of the ""Studio 54"" (2018) documentary. A place that was legendary and fun and necessary - probably still is. Very watchable on a big screen if you can.",7.0
1304588,Agents,"Set in Mauritius, this is a really quite unimaginative action thriller that is largely ruined by some serious overacting by a baddie (who thinks he's Travis Fimmel) and by some fairly shameless heavy hints that their homeland is very much in the ambit of the Chinese. It's those latter folks that agree to exhibit a priceless jade on the island, and it's down to policeman ""Shaw"" (Nad Sham) to lead the team protecting it. It's here that the wheels start to come off the story. It's pitch black so they decide to take it through dense forest where, of course, they are ambushed and it gets pinched. Now disgraced, his boss is forced to allow ""Yuan"" (Naomi Willow) to help with the investigation to track it down. The remainder of this might have made for a passable detective yarn had it not been for the really bad acting, clunky writing and a tendency from the director to attempt to create pace and excitement by messing about with the speed of the film. The car chase looks like a commercial for Porsche and/or Mercedes Benz, the combat scenes are choreographed so as to make any decent attempt at continuity all but impossible - and that shows, and Willow's performance is just plain wooden. There's nothing remotely original to it and though only eighty minutes long, it proves to be a long struggle to understand why it's in a cinema at all.

Anyway, not that it matters but the plot involves a troop of commandos who find themselves stranded in France after a botched raid. Initially under the command of the pretty useless ""Lt. Quayle"" (Mark Kitto) they proceed to lurch from frying pan to fire aided by some woeful dialogue, basic special effects and an ensemble performance that does nothing for the CVs of James Oliver Wheatley, Sophie Craig or auteur Bill Thomas who has created what is frankly a waste of file space. It has a video game feel to the it this - the episodic nature of the story evolves in waves, resets in a different location - farmhouse, barn, roadside - then we start again with more expletives and profundities from the embattled squad.

Despite the fact that he's only just got laid in a field, he's captivated by her and so when she comes to say hello after her routine, he is quite besotted. Thing is - well those Adam's Apples - they are a dead giveaway and ""Luke"" flees in polite terror, but terror nonetheless. This leaves ""Aysha"" with a problem, though, as her possessive pal ""Faiz"" (Sagar Radia) goes off in a strop leaving her without a lift to a lucrative gig in Birmingham. She was also a bit smitten by ""Luke"" so tracks him down to the garage he works in with his father, and offers him £200 to be her chauffeur. Reluctant, he remembers that he has promised is son ""Jamie"" (Taylor Sullivan) a trip to Disneyland, and that's not going to pay for itself. The journey isn't really that far, but when a few other drag queens cadge a lift, too - well, let's just say that ""Luke"" gets a look at a culture he's never experienced before. The plot itself is fairly predictable, not dissimilar to ""Femme"" from last year, but there's a fun degree of chemistry between Hardy and Patel that maybe a little too simplistically, but still entertainingly, both challenges and reinforces stereotypes. What's eminently clear is that ""Ashiq"" is an unhappy and unfulfilled man who comes alive when his alter ego takes over, but is there any future at all in a friendship quite so viscerally at odds. It's tightly cast, and works best when it's just the two lead actors engagingly messing about, getting to know and trust each other and, well... who knows? To be fair, it doesn't need a cinema screening but it is an amiable, occasionally bitchy, film and I quite enjoyed it.",7.0
964851,Ohjus,"Who would have thought that a reserved, homespun single mother of two married to an abusive imprisoned husband could turn her life around by writing about the dangers of nuclear proliferation? But, if you’re Niina Kuittinen (Oona Airola), a young housewife living in rural Lapland, that’s precisely what happens when she takes a reporting job with a local newspaper and unwittingly stumbles into a story that almost any intrepid journalist would kill for – the crash of an off-course Soviet missile in the Finnish wilderness in 1984. She eagerly investigates the incident, despite limited experience as a reporter, little knowledge of nuclear weapons and resistance from her publisher (Hannu-Pekka Björkman), who doesn’t want to upset the locals with such depressing talk, insisting instead on running only upbeat but innocuous human interest stories. Niina is undeterred, however, throwing herself into a story that garners international attention, regardless of the challenges she faces. In doing so, she grows and matures, finding her footing as a newly empowered woman, as well as finding new love in a handsome, adoring and attentive military man (Pyry Kähkönen). Niina’s transformation gives her purpose and helps her to prepare for the impending release of her incarcerated toxic husband (Tommi Eronen), who returns home promising he’s changed, despite evidence to the contrary. Niina’s new life thus begins, ironically, thanks to her immersion in a devastating subject – but one that ultimately imbues her with a healthier, more realistic outlook on the wider world and the nature of her existence. Writer-director Miia Tervo’s fact-based third feature outing is another of those unexpected cinematic gems that effectively mixes genres in coming up with a delightful and enlightening film. Much of the first half presents a colorful portrait of the protagonist’s hometown, family and neighbors, featuring ample humor that’s decidedly quirky, deliciously deadpan and superbly understated, not unlike the folksy, unassuming laughs prevalent in movies like “Fargo” (1996). But, as Niina’s story unfolds, it takes on more serious overtones as viewers witness the character develop into someone who leaves behind the crippling naivete and obsequiousness that have long been holding her back. Admittedly, the film begins to drag a bit in the last act, needlessly stretching out material that’s easy to predict without having to belabor it. Nevertheless, “The Missile” is one of those pictures that audience members are likely to come away from feeling as though they’ve been warmly welcomed into a community of loving family and friends whom they’ve known for a long time but without the unduly burdensome trappings of schmaltz and sentimentality. And there’s a lot to be said for that, even if it takes a little taste of Armageddon to get us there.",8.0

Modern Star Trek has its fans and a place in the franchise’s illustrious history, but I believe Trek’s best years have long since passed. Nothing compares to the original series (TOS) and its accompanying films. Then there are TNG and DS9. Voyager and Enterprise are somewhere in there, too, I guess. 

Beginning in 2009, the JJ Abrams trilogy introduced Trek culture to a new audience, and things began to change. The times were a-changin’. 

While my issues with Abrams’ movies are numerous, I understand the necessity of transforming the franchise for younger viewers from thought-provoking, slow-burn character studies into over-the-top, fast-paced action movies. 

The success of these films landed Trek back on television, starting with Discovery in 2017. The problems I have with the new shows are polar opposites to the ones I had with JJ’s flick. While senseless action scenes don’t really belong in Trek, the absence of any finesse in the way it tackles IRL issues is jarring for old-school fans like myself. 

Trek is at its best when there is an underlying message to be read “between the lines” of an otherwise stock science fiction story. It’s no secret that the franchise has never been one to shy away from wearing THE societal motivations of its creators on its sleeves. However, it usually does so as a secondary priority with entertainment always being the key focus. 

New Trek just seems to air out any potential political grievances the show-runners may have with the subtlety of a brick to the face. I hate to use this term, but unfortunately, modern Star Trek is very “woke”, constantly shoving an agenda down your throat. While I may support several of these causes, I just don’t want them at the forefront of the storytelling. 

Now, with that rant on current Trek off my chest, I want to acknowledge that the original run was not flawless. A major complaint that many, including myself, have had over the years was the underwhelming and unsatisfying death of Captain Kirk in the seventh film, “Generations”. While tragically mishandled, I will be the first to defend Shatner’s performance here, giving the character an on-brand send-off.

However, if you know Kirk’s mythos, you’d know how reliant upon his comrades he was. While there were others, such as Bones and Scotty, Kirk was especially attached to his first mate, Spock, an alien from the planet Vulcan. With a friendship so deep, Kirk believed he would not die alone due to the bond shared between these men. 

Unfortunately, when Kirk’s ticket was finally punched, he was only flanked by Captain Picard, who was extensively just a stranger to Kirk, with not a one pointed-ear in sight. Since Kirk’s demise lacked any emotional closure to the pair’s relationship, fans and writers alike have tried to correct this mistake, but alas, to no avail. When Spock’s original actor, Leonard Nimoy passed away, we all were left a hole inside us that would seemingly never be filled. That is, until now…

With all of that preamble out of the way, I want to share with you something… special. The Roddenberry Archive and graphics company, “OTOY” has teamed up with several celebrated members of the Star Trek creative family to bring us the short film “765874-Unification”. 
In short, Unification is a love letter to old fans like myself, while incorporating elements from the modern day in order to tell a new story with legacy characters. 

Through the use of state-of-the-art computer graphics, amazing make-up, and an eye for detail, this 7 1/2-minute film manages to draw out a response from me that no other Star Trek has come close to eliciting. 

As a grown kid, I have no beef with admitting that I have cried each time I have watched this beautiful homage. I weep at the love and care shown toward the franchise that has kept me from falling into despair on more than one occasion. 

Through incredible CGI (what I presume is deepfake technology), the man, myth, and legend himself, William Shatner returns to the role he made internationally famous more than 5 decades ago. Physically, the part of Kirk is portrayed by the always amazing Sam Witwer. He captures the body language and subtle gestures of prime Kirk, it’s almost uncanny. 

If having Shatner back isn’t enough, the lovely Robin Curtis also returns as Saavik, as well as a motion capture cameo from Gary Lockwood. These 3 actors returning to the characters after all of these years is a delight for any old-school Trekkie!

There are also cameos and references from newer Star Trek, with each instance being appropriate for the story and rewarding for the viewer to recognize. 

The presence of Spock is recreated using a new actor, incredible prosthetics and makeup, as well as a few CG touch-ups. The effects are mostly seamless and extremely convincing.

Fans of modern Trek will enjoy the music, as “Unification” is scored by Trek alumni Michael Giacchino. The soundtracks from the recent films and series are some of the highlights of the whole franchise, so I find his inclusion in this “love letter” very appropriate.

Not a word of dialogue is spoken throughout, except for a sample excerpt from “Wrath of Khan”. Words aren’t needed as fans watching have waited for something like this for a long time, and I agree with the sentiment that dialogue would have only detract from the sum. 

As for what happens, I’m gonna leave it as spoiler-free as possible and encourage anyone and everyone to go watch it! OTOY and The Roddenberry Archive have produced a few other shorts in this variation, so seek those out as well. They are all worth a view. If you want to discuss it afterward, please contact me and tell me if you regressed to a sobbing baby like I did. 

In the end, if you’re not a fan of the franchise, you may find the technology behind “Unification” worth a watch by itself. It is truly impressive that something of this caliber was created in Unity, of all programs, is astounding. 

However, for the fanatics, the true Trekkies, what awaits you is like nothing you’ve ever seen before, but hopefully, it will be something Paramount can show us again and again for years to come. If by chance, the studio is reading this, I encourage you to keep the new Trek for the new fans. That’s fine. All I am suggesting is showcasing to these newbies a bit of what made Star Trek special to begin with. At least, maybe once every so often?

When the credits begin to roll, we see “For Leonard Nimoy” and seeing the surnames Shatner, Nimoy, and Roddenberry as executive producers, it becomes clear the friendships, family dynamics, and hopeful future depicted in Classic Trek is the true final frontier. 

Whether you’re a casual fan or a dedicated member of Starfleet, this short film, “Unification” has boldly gone where few projects have gone before. Live long and prosper Star Trek!",9.0
1241231,Firecracker,"I admit right up front I’m an Andrew Lee Potts fan. He won me over with his performance in the TV show **""Primeval""** (and THAT hat!) and since then, I do try to keep up with his projects. Just yesterday I watched **“Firecracker.”**

When I see a movie, I want to be entertained; I don’t want to be constantly taken out of the moment by inconsistencies in writing or acting or things that don’t make a lot of sense in the circumstances of the characters. And I give some freedom before passing judgment on a lot of things, because sometimes we’re meant to be confused for a time until parts of a plot come together in other ways. And, frankly, sometimes the character is actually meant to be a little stupid in some way, so doing something that doesn’t make sense is, well, purposeful (think ‘yell at the screen’ frustration about a choice a character makes).

Without giving away spoilers directly, I will say I had some emotional ups and downs as the movie progressed, and at one [dramatic] point wasn’t particularly pleased. I even yelled at the screen once or twice. But by the end I was OK again and had enjoyed the ride. Some dramatic license was taken a couple times, especially with technologies, but that seems common nowadays, and at least wasn’t particularly stupid, just over-a-line of possibility. But we were introduced to the characters, and shown various believable motivations for their behavior. The story unfolded and we learned more about them and what they were doing. We even got a chance to have compassion for some of them caught in the circumstance as they were. If I had any complaint, it might be the speed at which we ran through twists and turns towards the end… I think some folks might find it hard to follow without some pause/rewind/replay. 

But I had fun watching it; it accomplished what it set out to do very well. And I enjoyed the cast of characters, both as actors and as the characters they played. Pacing was pretty consistent, too. I think I could even watch it again relatively soon and not be bored with it.",9.0
1232889,Malta,"The slice-of-life drama “Malta” offers a thoughtful exploration of one woman’s journey towards self-discovery amidst the challenges of adulthood. Write / director Natalia Santa’s small but deeply resonant film delves into the complexities and feeling of being stuck in life while searching for a means of escape. It is thoughtful, intimate, and incredibly well done.  

Young Columbian woman Mariana (Estefania Piñeres) is navigating the challenges of being an adult. She’s trying to earn a living by working long hours at a call center while balancing the struggles and stress of dealing with her dysfunctional family. Mariana daydreams about escaping her reality by traveling the world, and she especially wants to visit the Mediterranean island of Malta. But when she strikes up a relationship with a classmate, the true motives behind her strong desire to leave it all behind are confronted.  

Anyone who has ever felt stuck and unfulfilled with find a lot of material that resonates here, and Santa writes a character that is highly relatable. Boosted by the strong lead performance from Piñeres, the film’s understated tone lends authenticity and depth to this story of self-discovery, quietly exploring Mariana’s internal battles and desires.  

“Malta” is a quiet, thoughtful film that captures moments of everyday life, common insecurities and aspirations, as well as the universal quest for meaning and fulfillment.

1211087,Christspiracy,"A fresh take on what ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"" really means and the horrors of animal slaughter disguised as ""sacrifice"" at the Jewish temples. As a historian and someone has been very interested and in ancient writings I can say that the history of the Christian Church is fraught with pogroms and murders of people who had a more evolved and humanitarian take on Jesus and the bible. I hope that more open-minded free thinking Christians and religious types watch this and start to reform the church, again, from the inside out.",10.0
1205520,Tabby McTat,"There's no sign of Luke Treadaway nor of ""Bob"" in this similar tale of a busker and his cat in London. Luckily for the narrator, the cat's name rhymes with loads of other words as we tell a tale of them being robbed; 'Fred"" giving chase and breaking his leg; them becoming separated, ""Tabby"" wasting no time falling in love and then - well don't we hope they all reunite? It's perhaps a bit long and there's no getting away from the repetitive ""cat, sat, mat, that, hat, chat"" rhyming dialogue but that said, the animation is quite engaging and the story one of affection and loyalty, tinged with a touch of mischief. It's not exactly Aardman, but it's still enjoyable enough for half an hour - especially if you're a cat-lover!",6.0
1128836,Sehidup Semati,"Sehidup Semati powerfully explores the psychological impact of patriarchal beliefs and emotional abuse in marriage, portraying how societal pressure forces women to endure toxic relationships under the guise of “till death do us part.” Through artistic symbolism, intense performances, and an unpredictable plot, the film presents horror not through ghosts, but through mental anguish and emotional control. Despite its sensitive religious undertone, the film successfully delivers a chilling, thought-provoking psychological thriller that demands serious attention and reflection.

1120903,盜月者,"Though it does over-complicate the plot at times. I did quite enjoy this daft crime caper set amidst the world of luxury watches. ""Vincent"" (Edan Lui) is a bit of a whizz when it comes to creating fake watches. He scavenges original parts, though, he is no cheap and cheerful merchant. He's also got a game going validating valuable timepieces for the wealthy, but clueless, folks who rather foolishly trust him to be honest!! Anyway, the plastic jacket-clad local kingpin ""Uncle"" (Keung To) - who looks about twelve - has his eyes set on a triptych of one-off devices that were supposedly worn by Picasso and lost after his death. They've turned up for auction in Tokyo, so ""Vincent"" is cajoled into the project along with his handsome buddy ""Yoh"" (Anson Lo) and two henchmen - the ""Chief"" (Louis Cheung) and his dim-witted muscle ""Mario"" (Michael Ning) and soon enough they are in Japan laying the plans for an intricate sting operation. ""Vincent"" has had a lifelong passion for the ""Moonwatch"". This is the watch worn by Buzz Aldrin when he went to the moon - but it, too, has disappeared. When it turns out that it, too, is at the same jewellers the whole carefully orchestrated operation goes a bit awry and that causes all of our would-be thieves to think again about what they are doing, why they are doing it - and just what's the motive of their childlike boss back home. Lui is quite efficient here as the boffin-thief, and there's a decent pace as the drama, peppered with a little comedy and an entertaining heist scenario flows along well enough until the lively conclusion. That's a wee bit convoluted, but it just about works with a solid production, not too much script and a few engaging on-screen performances from a cast who looked like they were enjoying this lark.",7.0
1063829,Hauntology,"Hauntology is somewhat difficult to categorize, this anthology less of a pure horror film and more a collection of spooky stories that explore the things that haunt us. Definitely more ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"" or ""Carnival of Souls"", than it is ""Terrifier"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"".

Writer-Director Parker Brennon directs all segments, creating a film that pays homage to several classic sub-genres, making Hauntology a tapestry of horror, supernatural scifi, Giallo slasher, monster movie, and psychological tension across it's stories. The thread binding Hauntology's narrative fabric together is the isolation, fear, and ""otherness"" experienced in queer, BIPOC, and feminine perspectives, subtly explored by Brennon and an ensemble cast that is particularly impressive for this small independent film. Those haunting elements of the film are further invoked by the film's intentional pace and atmospheric photography, perfectly matched by a score that manages to somehow sound both foreboding and eerily cheerful.

There are also a lot of cool easter eggs throughout that probably make rewatches worth while.",8.0
1027938,Milchzähne,"""Skalde"" (Mathilde Bundschuh) is really only just tolerated by her rural community having been born to a stranger (Susanne Wolf) in this tightly-knit, introspective, village. Their society works on a bartering system - she trades slurry with her neighbours and thanks to the friendly, but qualified, support of local elder ""Pesolt"" (Ulrich Matthes) and the more feisty support from ""Gösta"" (Karin Neuhäuser) they get by. That's all challenged though when the village dogs start to behave erratically just as she encounters a young girl ""Meisis"" (Viola Hinz) who has come from the forest and whom they take in. The hugely superstitious population decide that she is some sort of harbinger of evil, and demand that she be sent away, but ""Skalde"" is determined that she's just an ordinary young lass and refuses to co-operate. This earns her the enmity of a populace who now largely shun her. Might now be a time for ""Skalde"" to consider whether this is the best place for her and the youngster to live - especially as the mutterings from her erstwhile neighbours is becoming a little more menacing? This film is set contemporaneously, which makes the plot all the more effective when it deals with aspects of a local lupine mysticism that seems so anachronistic coming from people who routinely use cars and mobile phones! Sophia Bösch works the pace well, and the very less-is-more style of delivery from Bundschuh helps create an atmospheric drama that's tense at times, engaging at others - and the film never quite gives them, or us, the answers that we might expect.",7.0
1009701,Maxxie LaWow: Drag Super-shero,"Gorgeous Animation! Funny story.
I had the pleasure of watching Maxxie LaWow: Drag Super-shero on the big screen at the OutShine Film Festival in Miami Beach. The animation is GORGEOUS!!!! It's incredibly rare to see an animated feature made 100% independently as Maxxie was. And...it was made entirely in the US. There was constant laughter throughout the film and it was fun watching all the toes tapping and heads nodding to the music. The story is truly fun, silly and uplifting. It's a story for all ages. From kids to us older folks. There's something for everyone to enjoy. This is a true gem of a film that can be enjoyed on so many levels. Whether it's the coming of age story, or the meanest of the mean villains, or the super-shero who comes to save the day. Enjoy!",10.0
1009701,Maxxie LaWow: Drag Super-shero,"An animated drag queen superhero? Sounds like something cooked up in a focus group. But this movie's got style for days. The animation's like a mash-up of all those Saturday morning cartoons we used to veg out to, but cranked up to 11. It's trippy in all the right ways.

The story is of an insecure barista who transforms into this badass drag queen superhero. The villain is called Dyna Bolical - I mean, come on, that's just clever.

The voice acting's solid. Pretty sure I recognized some legit drag queens in there. They nailed the whole campy vibe without making it too cheesy. It's the kind of flick you can watch with your buddies or your family to have a some fun.

There's a message about being yourself and all that, but it doesn't beat you over the head with it. It's got heart without being sappy. The original songs are fun and add to the drag show vibe without being a drag on the action (couldn't resist).

Maxxie LaWow: Drag Super-shero is worth your time. Grab a beer, order a pizza, and give it a shot. You might be surprised.",
1009701,Maxxie LaWow: Drag Super-shero,"We had an absolute blast watching Maxxie LaWow: Drag Super-Shero! The music was perfectly matched to every moment, the writing was sharp and hilarious—we laughed out loud several times—and the entire film was a vibrant, joyful ride through Maxxie’s fabulous origin story.

998137,填詞L,"Though it does labour the joke a little after a while, this is actually quite a fun story about a tenacious young student who is determined to be a lyricist. Despite the fact that her teacher (Pak Hon Chu) claims nobody ever makes money writing songs (he's clearly never heard of Don Black, or Sir Tim Rice or Bernie Taupin!), and the fact that she cannot actually read music, she perseveres. She's not having much luck though - most of her work ends up being ""off-melody"" - with some quite hilariously double-entendre consequences, but ""Sze"" (Suet-Ying Chung) is determined. Now it doesn't really help the gist of this that many of her rhymes go to prove the obvious point that English, Cantonese and Mandarin have completely different tones and rhyming points - and that means that sometimes the subtitled versions of her lyrics are borderline surreal. They don't scan in the slightest in just about any language and her attempts to find a musician and/or singer to work with just seem doomed to failure. She's persistent, though, and as the years go by she does just about everything to convince the record industry that her's is a skill they want! This works quite well at engagingly poking fun at the whole songwriting business. The haphazard way in which things work - or don't, the sheer luck involved, good looks, face fits, back-stabbing and well, you have to feel just a bit sorry for her long suffering boyfriend ""Zeke"" (Yukki Tai) and, for that matter, her easy on the eye chanteur ""Mak"" (Anson Chan) who constantly vacillates between encouraging and placating her somewhat erratic passion. It's a story about a dream (and for a listening audience - a nightmare) and is quite enjoyable to watch.",7.0
1392347,Doctor Who: The War Games in Colour,"Oh boy, I knew The War Games in Colour was going to be rough from the moment they announced the runtime, but I didn't know it could go this wrong so fast... with every. passing. minute. Benjamin Cook, I hope you never get to edit one of these ever again. Stay away—far away.

I re-watched The War Games only the other day just to remind myself how good the original serial is; The War Games in Colour just amplifies everything wrong with The Daleks in Colour and becomes a truly sour viewing experience. Granted, I can't fault the guys who did the colourisation, some of the choices are utterly tremendous (minus that one moment where the picture inexplicably becomes black and white for a second) but the moment-to-moment editing is completely borked beyond belief utterly destroying any sense of tension, atmosphere or thematic relevance the original serial had in spades.

I will say that Mark Ayres' music this time around was a little better, but still very ill-fitting. The original cues from Dudley Simpson are thankfully still here but they get drowned out by a metric cacophony overlaying noises. The kicker for me however, was the use of The Master’s theme for The War Chief, that’s completely unacceptable. The new effects are a huge mixed bag, the new establishing shots of the locations are nice but the big CG “Earth” opening is rough and, of course, the ""new"" regeneration being the big one is the most egregious, it’s not terribly done but feels so out of place due to the use of the NuWho orange fire effects. The cast is extremely ill-served by Ben Cook's hacksaw approach to editing, Philip Modac's War Lord is basically a passing cameo which annoyed me so much, also wtf did they do to his eyes?!

Like I've said a few times in the past, I'm all for seeing Old Who with a new coat of paint, but The War Games in Colour is the wrong way to go about it, it’s utterly barbaric and a total misrepresentation of the original serials' greatness, it’s only saving grace is the colourisation. It started relatively alright but fell to pieces very quickly, Ben Cook should never cook again.",1.0
1388244,From Roger Moore with Love,"...or maybe from Roger with Moore love? If you saw the recent ""Mad About the Boy"" documentary on Sir Noël Coward, you'll recall the use of a voice actor to impersonate the subject of the story as he narrates it. Well that's the technique used here as the late Sir Roger takes us on a whistle stop tour of his own ninety year life. This film benefits from him being of a generation where the archive is a little more readily available as he rises to stardom, marries a few times, makes his name in the ""Saint"" (after a bit of tonsil hockey with Lana Turner in 1956) before he takes over from Connery as ""007"" and the rest, as they say. It appears he was himself an avid film maker so there are plenty of home movies as he entertained the great and good at his Swiss home, and with contributions from his children and a few closer to him than the usual panoply of talking-head movie journalists, this is quite an interesting look at a man who made a career from being a bit of a chauvinist, but who actually comes across as really anything but. Aside from one Golden Globe in 1980, more in the heartthrob category, his industry never really recognised that glint in his eye nor that eyebrow above it with a mind of it's own, so it's nice to reflect on a star who oozed charisma on screen small and large, was under no illusions about his own foibles and certainly didn't take him self seriously at all.",7.0
1275261,Rebellious,"The feisty princess is in love with the slightly geeky ""Ronan"" but her father is more concerned that her future husband be capable of defending the kingdom and so favours a more robust suitor for his daughter's hand. Maybe that's the local beefcake ""Rogdai"" (think ""Gaston"" from ""Beauty and the Beast""). Before any of this has to be decided, however, the nasty sorcerer ""Kezabor"" sends his pet dragon to kidnap her and desperate to retrieve her, the king promises her to her rescuer. ""Ronan"", ""Rogdai"" and the rather maternally henpecked ""Fa Chan"" now set off on some adventures to find the sorcerer's castle and hopefully save the youngster from a fate worse than death. Nope, there's nothing original here but to be fair it isn't trying to hide that fact. There are nods to established folklore (""Rapunzel"" chief amongst them) as we encounter loads of mythical beasties and prove that the most valiant is not necessarily the biggest, bravest or boldest. The Arabian Nights style theme works fine for ninety minutes with some colourfully vivid animation - lots of big eyes and out of proportion bodies, and the plot delivers exactly what you might expect. It's a competently produced story that ought to engage the kids on the television at Christmas, but it's all pretty run-of-the-mill stuff that you will soon forget. Nothing wrong with a bit of turban-charged girl power.",6.0
1203498,Fyre Rises,"What makes Fyre Rises stand out is its ambition. It’s clear that the filmmakers poured their hearts into this project, and that passion shines through in many areas. The film follows a classic redemption arc, which is engaging even if it doesn’t offer much originality. The lead performance is one of the movie’s greatest strengths. The protagonist is both vulnerable and determined, and the actor skilfully balances these traits, making the character relatable and compelling.
The action sequences are where the movie truly shines. They are raw, grounded, and feel as though the stakes are real. Unlike the over-polished fights in big-budget films, these sequences rely on realism, which makes them far more engaging. The cinematography, too, deserves praise. The use of tight, claustrophobic shots during action scenes creates tension, while the wider, atmospheric shots highlight the protagonist’s isolation in the urban landscape.
That said, the film is not without its flaws. The pacing is uneven, especially in the middle portion, where the story takes too long to develop secondary characters who ultimately don’t add much. The dialogue, while functional, often feels stilted, and some scenes could have been trimmed to improve flow. Despite these issues, Fyre Rises delivers a gritty and heartfelt story that indie film enthusiasts will appreciate.",8.0
1203498,Fyre Rises,"It's rough around the edges, but its heart and ambition shine through. The story isn't groundbreaking, but it's told with sincerity and has enough twists to keep you engaged.

The acting is solid, particularly from the lead, who manages to convey vulnerability and strength in equal measure. The action sequences are gritty and grounded, though the editing occasionally felt choppy, which took me out of the moment.

What really stood out was the cinematography. Despite the budget constraints, the filmmakers used every trick in the book to create a visually engaging experience. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth a watch for fans of low-budget gems.",8.0
1178574,爸爸,"This is a tough film to watch, but it’s worth it. “Papa” (Ching-wan Lau) runs a bustling café and we first meet him looking forlornly at his apartment from the street outside. It transpires that there has been a double-murder and that his wife and daughter have been stabbed to death by their son. The young lad has openly admitted the crime and is soon committed for psychiatric care as schizophrenia is suspected. Over the next two hours we learn a bit about the family dynamic and each character has their moment in the sun to explain just who they are and how they fit into this tight and typically loving and bickering family unit. Of course, there are signs that “Ming” (Dylan So) has some sort of mental illness, but like any family they are confident that with love and care they can manage this, and for the most part the teenager appears to thrive with his mum (Kam Yin) and lively sister “Yan” (Lainey Hung). What comes across strongly here are the older man’s senses of grief and disbelief, yes - but also of his guilt at not being there to stop the attack, or even to succumb to it; and there is also a palpable sense of forgiveness emanating from a man who ought to hate his son deeply but who doesn’t. As we delve deeper into the story, it’s left up to us to form our opinions about what may or not have been warning signs or triggers as well as appreciating just how difficult it was for this couple running a 24/7 business that left them emotionally drained and sleep deprived at the best of times. It’s a film about coping, prioritising and doing the best possible and just like everyone else, hoping that we can be left to cruise along undisturbed by trauma - large or small. It’s not a doom-laden exercise, there is a fair degree of light-heartedness and a great deal of eating (well it’s more like shovelling, really) has there’s even a mother-in-law joke! Now there are some quirks in this production that do occasionally make you think that the director wasn’t paying enough attention and as with anything trying to weave timelines and characters together, the continuity is not the best - but if you take a wide vision view of just how a tightly-knit family deals with life, love, disaster and possibly forgiveness then this is a poignant film to watch with solid efforts from both Ching-wan Lau and from a less prominent, but still effective, Dylan So.",7.0
1159452,Unsinkable: Titanic Untold,"This hasn't really anything much to do with the Titanic, it's more to do with the politically motivated inquiry carried out by American presidential hopeful Senator Smith (Cotter Smith). Immediately the news of the sinking breaks, he decides that he is going to appoint himself as the chairmen of a senatorial committee to investigate the tragedy. When the ""RMS Carpathia"" arrives in New York with survivors, he proceeds to arbitrarily detain them all - reducing many to living on the streets eating from soup kitchens and huddling around bin-fires in the cold, while he plays judge and jury with the surviving crew and the White Star Line's manager director Bruce Ismay (Sam Turich). This way he can ensure he keeps his name in the papers and look like some sort of avenging angel. It's actually the papers who begin to prove the more honest of the assessors here, though, as young reporter ""Alaine Ricard"" (Fiona Dourif) quite perilously manages to get to the truth not just about what might have happened at sea that night, but of also identifying the senator's motives and the connection between US corporate interests and the likely commencement of the Great War in Europe. Karen Allen features for about two minutes as his supportive wife, thereafter this is just a really rather lacklustre television drama that I found increasingly difficult to take seriously. The interrogations by his committee are riddled with leading questions, hindsight and contradictions - to the point where anyone with the slightest of legal backgrounds would have told him to take an hike. It plays to just about every class stereotype you can imagine and even if it did have some legitimate points to make about what might have been preventable on the day and criticisms to make of the behaviour of some of those concerned, these were lost amongst the weakly written dialogue and the arrogance of the investigator. I am afraid this disappoints from start to the rather lacklustre conclusion. I'm surprised that this got a cinema release in the UK, it's really very poor.",5.0
1115104,Your Fat Friend,"They say you can never truly understand what it’s like to feel what someone else experiences until you’ve walked a mile in his or her shoes. That’s often been said about many of those in minority communities, and, thankfully, some progress in understanding appears to have been made in those cases over the years. But one segment of society in which little advancement has been made involves those who are appreciably bigger than many in the mainstream (i.e., those who are fat). For some reason, fat folks continue to be systematically marginalized – if not outright derided – in countless ways, and there’s often been little that they can do about these pervasive attacks. Now, however, writer-director Jeanie Finlay’s new documentary profile of author/podcaster/fat activist Aubrey Gordon sheds new light on what individuals affected by this condition face on a daily basis. This includes the persistent lack of meaningful accommodations in areas like effective health care, transportation and garment manufacturing, not to mention the ignorant, cruel, short-sighted and insensitive comments made by others, including those who mistakenly think they’re operating from a standpoint of good intentions. The film explores Gordon’s journey from an anonymous (and devastatingly ridiculed) blogger to best-selling author who came out of the closet about her weight circumstances and made public the often-overlooked anguish experienced by people of size. The film holds back little in terms of exposing the unbridled scorn thrust upon her and those who are similarly situated, while simultaneously celebrating the overflowing shower of support bestowed on her by others like her who now feel that there’s someone in their camp to make their feelings and the truth of their circumstances known. The picture also goes on the record exposing the many myths and lies that have been long perpetuated about fat people and the volumes of bad, uninformed advice they have received for decades, particularly from the medical community, many of whose members don’t have a clue when it comes to what they’re talking about. Admittedly, the material covered in the film could be a little better organized at times, especially when it turns redundant, as it does on several occasions. There is also a fair amount of unrelated incidental footage that probably could have been cut without losing much. However, this offering provides a wealth of information on the widely circulated misinformation about fatness, and, as anyone who has endured these conditions – like me, in the interest of full disclosure – can attest, it’s refreshing and liberating to see an advocate step forward who is not afraid to call out those who are hurtful, ignorant and deceitful when it comes to this subject. “Your Fat Friend” draws all of these issues into focus and delivers a polite but undeniably pointed middle finger to those who perpetuate misguided attitudes and ideas that ultimately serve no one – yet end up unintentionally or deliberately hurting so many.",7.0
1095826,Crónicas de una santa errante,"Many of us would probably look upon the traits of piety and ambition as a somewhat unlikely, perhaps even contradictory combination of qualities. The temptation to take questionable short-cuts on the path to spiritual fulfillment and maturity thus might be a little too great to remain true to one’s otherwise-authentic spiritual intentions. And that’s just what Rita López (Mónica Villa), an allegedly reverent aging parish custodian from a rural Argentine village, finds out for herself in writer-director Tomás Gómez Bustillo’s debut feature, an offbeat supernatural comedy-drama that defies easy categorization. The hard-working but underappreciated caretaker, who’s trapped in a childless, under-satisfying marriage to her needy husband, Norberto (Horacio Marassi), prays for a miracle to rectify her unrewarding circumstances, and she believes she finds it when she discovers what’s thought to be a long-missing statue of the Virgin Mary that disappeared mysteriously. But is it authentic? Rita’s not completely sure, but with a little cosmetic doctoring and begrudging assistance from her husband, she convinces herself that she’s made a legitimate find that genuinely qualifies as a miracle, one that can put her on a path to enlightenment, if not sainthood. However, her overly zealous fudging of the facts unwittingly launches her onto an incredible, unexpected, eye-opening, surrealistic odyssey that brings her face to face with her own truth and destiny. The film accomplishes this through a clever and inspired mix of gentle but inventive humor, touching moments and heartfelt revelations. This three-time 2023 Independent Spirit Award nominee is an odd but delicious little gem of a movie, one ably supported by its gorgeous cinematography, emotive background score and simple but whimsical special effects. Admittedly, several story elements could use some shoring up and greater development, along with brisker pacing in the opening 30 minutes. The film’s credits are also somewhat strangely placed, coming between the picture’s first and second acts rather than at the more typical beginning or end. Nevertheless, those who appreciate the unconventional are sure to relish this quirky offering, one that previously had a brief and limited theatrical run but is now thankfully available for streaming online. So give it a look. You just might find it to be an answer to your cinematic prayers.",8.0
1069200,المعلم,"""Adam"" (Muhammad Abed Elrahman) and his recently incarcerated brother ""Yacoub"" (Mahmoud Bakri) are facing the compulsory demolition of their home to facilitate the arrival of new Israeli settlers and an altercation sees the latter lad killed and the former bent of revenge. His teacher ""Basem"" (Saleh Bakri) and a visiting volunteer ""Lisa"" (Imogen Poots) try to intervene to stop him doing anything stupid, and insist that they follow legal process. Well it's fairly clear that that isn't going to deliver very much, but as the teacher and the volunteer start to become a little more familiar with each other, we also realise it's equally clear that ""Basem"" is a little more hands-on with the resistance than his public persona might suggest. Indeed, when he becomes actively embroiled in the search for a kidnapped Israeli soldier of American parentage, his relationship with both the audience and the increasingly frustrated youth becomes rather different. It's really quite a touching story, this one. Not in an overly sentimental way, but in a manner that illustrates clearly how people feel when they are wronged and then failed by a judicial system that is institutionally stacked against them. State sponsored indifference and cruelty coupled with a general sense of lawlessness (on both sides) potently fuels generations of hatred and mistrust and here we see just how it readily perpetuates long-held feelings of anger and loathing. The production looks grimly authentic, and both both Poots and Bakri deliver well but it's really the effort from the young Elrahman that stands out. Initially a decent and calming influence on his more impetuous brother, circumstances force him to become something that he might not have otherwise been. Once on that course, is he beyond any restraining from taking a journey down a very black brick road? The inclusion of the searching US parents - mainly Stanley Townsend as the father, serves to remind us that there are two sides to the story and that brutality isn't just a tool reserved for whomsoever might appear the oppressor here, and as the story concludes it does so as it starts, amidst an environment of uncertainty and fear whilst ruins pile up around those whose only real goal is to live in peace amongst the olive groves their families have harvested for centuries. It's a powerful drama that only goes to prove how much easier it is to destroy than to build.",7.0
1069200,المعلم,"The myriad challenges of daily living in the Occupied Palestinian Territories of Gaza and the West Bank have increasingly become the subject of documentary and narrative features in recent years, chronicling the many hardships local residents face in just getting by. These films have collectively addressed an array of subjects, such as the encroachment of Israeli settlements, capricious residential demolition orders, constant and harsh government scrutiny and deferred justice for Palestinians. And all of these issues are now explored in this debut offering from writer-director Farah Nabulsi. Loosely inspired by true events, the film follows the complicated life of West Bank high school English teacher Basem El-Saleh (Saleh Bakri), a man beset by a troubled past (presented in flashbacks) and a genuine desire to help his students live better lives (most notably brothers Adam (Muhammad Abed Elrahman) and Yacoub (Mahmoud Bakri)) while clandestinely maintaining his commitment to his people’s political resistance movement. At the same time, by contrast, Basem also wrestles with his budding romantic feelings for Lisa (Imogen Poots), a compassionate English transplant who works as a youth counselor at his school. On the surface, this combination of narrative elements would seem to provide the makings of an engaging story, but the presentation of Basem’s often-conflicted life often feels somewhat clumsy, disjointed and meandering, as if the picture doesn’t always know what direction it wants to take. In the process, it frequently feels like it’s systematically ticking off items to be addressed from a checklist of issues commonly faced by the Palestinian population under Israeli occupation. What’s more, the film’s romantic storyline is somewhat overplayed, often drawing audience attention away from its more relevant story elements. In short, the execution here leaves something to be desired. This is not to suggest that the issues probed here are unimportant; they most certainly are significant. However, their handling here regularly feels awkward, leaving viewers wondering how (or if) everything will eventually tie together in the end. Consequently, “The Teacher” plays like a release that could have benefitted from some scrutinous script revisions and more judicious film editing to make for a more tightly focused finished product. The plight of the Palestinians is nothing to be minimized or marginalized, but, if movies are to help raise awareness of their circumstances, the vehicles used for doing so should do better justice to their situation than what’s apparent in this release.",6.0
977246,Brujería,"A family of German settlers in Chile engage the services of the young ""Rosa"" (Valentina Véliz Caileo) to keep their home for them until one morning, they discover that all of their sheep have died. With a rope loosely tied about each one's neck, ""Stefan"" (Sebastian Hülk) immediately concludes that this is the work of the indigenous population and starts to take it out on the girl. Her father intervenes only for the farmer to set his dogs on the man. Now rather brutally orphaned, she leaves to seek justice from the mayor (Daniel Muñoz). He proves worse than useless, but the priest suggest she try to find a roof with ""Mateo"" (Daniel Antivilo). It turns out that he is a decent man, surviving on subsistence fishing and well versed in the more mystic arts of their traditions. ""Rosa"" wants to avenge her father's murder and now, more and more absorbed into the ""Brujería"", events in their small village causes consternation for her previous employers as their two sons go missing - just as two young, and fairly docile, cubs arrive! What now ensues sees the Christian community react with a combination of fear and militarism, but will that be sufficient to combat the power of the sorcery that is clearly at work demanding restoration of the equilibrium with both nature and amongst the divided and bigoted people. It's quite slowly paced, and it might have been filmed in the wettest place on the continent, but that works quite well to illustrate the timelessness of a way of life that thrived before the colonists arrived. The symbiotic relationship between people and nature and faith is quite potently, yet delicately, demonstrated by some charming acting and the design of the production looks good and earthy too. It's not your traditional style of horror film - indeed it doesn't really fit into that genre at all, but it's still quite an eerie and creepy exercise in leaving the forces of nature in peace and doing unto others...",7.0
959892,Les tortues,"Is love enough to sustain a relationship? It can certainly provide a powerful bond to keep partners together, but is that sufficient to maintain that connection when other issues arise (e.g., day-to-day life challenges, disagreements and disconnects about fundamental goals and aspirations, cohabitation conflicts, a growing lack of sexual intimacy, etc.)? These matters often come to a head when certain turning points in life are reached, such as retirement, especially when each partner holds different views about what that next stage of life is supposed to be all about. These are among the challenges faced by Henri (Olivier Gourmet), a recently retired Brussels policeman, and his longtime partner, Thom (Dave Johns), a former drag queen and seller of secondhand merchandise who now spends most of his time as a househusband. Thom has been looking forward to this new phase in the couple’s lives, but Henri has been pulling away, seeking to follow a more individualized path, one that even includes encounters with other men (a practice he doesn’t try to hide, either). Needless to say, Thom is heartbroken and tries to reingratiate himself into his husband’s life but to no avail, an outcome that turns their relationship bitterly (though often hilariously) contentious. So what does the future hold for this long-term duo? It looks like divorce is certainly not out of the question. But is that what they really want? These are questions insightfully, honestly and sensitively explored in writer-director David Lambert’s fourth feature effort, a bittersweet romantic comedy-drama about what can happen when “things change.” It thoughtfully examines the soul searching and reevaluations that come with retirement, much the same way as in the Swiss comedy-drama “Golden Years” (“Die goldenen Jahre”) (2022), as well as the open hostility that can emerge between partners, as depicted in the dark comedy classic “The War of the Roses” (1989). The picture’s meticulously assembled, well-paced screenplay effectively examines all angles of this scenario through a narrative that’s touching, wickedly funny, heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time. This is backed by the superb performances of the film’s two leads, as well as the heart-tugging presence of an adorable police dog named Sherlock, who plays an integral role in how this story unfolds. This release is handily the best offering I screened at this year’s Reeling Film Festival (if not in all of the years I’ve been attending the event), as well as one of the best movies I’ve ever watched about relationship discord, regardless of sexual orientation. As the old song “Breaking Up Is Hard To Do” so astutely observes, the film definitely follows suit when it comes to that sentiment and does so with an eloquence and realism rarely seen on screen. Couples of all kinds faced with issues like these should give this one a look, as it will ultimately probably provide more hands-on insight into how to address their problems than any course of marriage counseling could ever do. Like the creatures cited in the film’s title, “Turtles” draws attention to the issues often encountered in these circumstances – and candidly shows that partners can’t afford to avoid confronting them by simply hiding in their shells.",10.0
1362614,TMZ Presents | The Downfall of Diddy 2: The Indictment,"Harvey Levin interviews and media footage covering the recent indictment of Sean Combs. Interviewees include media personalities, legal professionals, and even Combs' attorney, Marc Agnifilio.

The archival footage of Combs' speaking about what happens at his ""parties"" is alarming. The truth lies in his own words, words so freely spoken because those were the days he thought he was above the law, as he had previously eluded every effort to hold him accountable for alleged criminal activity. 

Combs' attorney is certainly earning his money. His spin on the details of the federal indictment are incredulous and could possibly sway... someone. Anyone who can't understand that drugging people to get them to participate in sex of any kind is a crime, not a threesome; anyone who doesn't understand that beating and kicking someone whose livelihood is controlled by the one doing the kicking and beating is not ""a fight"", it's abuse. Also anyone who thinks celebrities don't have to obey the law as the rest of us do. Those are the people who could be swayed by Agnifilio's spin on what the feds contend in the indictment.

Combs' attorney is also using the tired ""they're trying to bring a wealthy black man down"" defense. Skin color will NEVER fly as a defense when there is a video showing that at least part of the indictment has teeth.

Combs' attorney said Combs will take the stand to testify, which means he will be cross-examined by the state. 

This trial will be a hot one and I will be glued to CourtTV for the entirety. The day after the verdict I'll be waiting to watch ""TMZ Presents: The Downfall of Diddy The Prison Sentence"".",7.0

1229266,We Were Dangerous,"No matter what anyone might suggest to the contrary, generally speaking, girls will be girls, especially during those often-turbulent, rebellious adolescent years. What’s more, attempts at implementing “correction” are frequently frustrating and unsuccessful for those undertaking such efforts, an outcome that was usually just as true in the past as it is today. Such was the case in 1954 New Zealand, where a dozen social and sexual “deviants” were confined at the government-sponsored Te Motu School for Incorrigible and Delinquent Girls. The facility, located on a remote island that was once a leper colony and home to assorted misfits and undesirables, was established out of the alleged genuine concern of the state to help rehabilitate the behavior of young women gone astray with the aim of helping to transform them into proper ladies suitable for marriage and motherhood. This was accomplished by strictly following a three-step program of “Christianize, civilize and assimilate” (with particularly heavy emphasis on the first step). Narrated by the school’s stern, calculating, insincere head matron (Rima Te Wiata), the film chronicles the diverse life experiences and backgrounds of her girls, many of which are presented anecdotally and in flashbacks. Some of these incidents are wryly humorous (though quaintly archaic), while others are sad, tragic and profoundly unfair. As the story unfolds, however, matters take a more sinister and disturbing turn, one that prompts three of the island’s residents (Erana James, Manaia Hall, Nathalie Morris) to take cleverly clandestine yet courageously assertive steps to fight back to protect themselves and their peers from a potentially catastrophic and appalling fate. Writer-director Josephine Stewart-Te Whiu’s debut feature tells an engaging, economically paced coming of age tale (said to be inspired by actual events). The “life at a rigidly run girls’ reform school” narrative might be seen by some as rather episodic, formulaic and trite, but those shortcomings are handily overcome by elements that distinguish this offering from others of its kind, namely, its superb writing, excellent character development (especially among the residents and colorful supporting cast members), a well-balanced and deftly combined mix of comedy and drama, and gorgeous location cinematography. Then there are the outstanding performances of the ensemble, most notably James, Morris, Hall (who had no prior acting experience and auditioned for her role on a lark), and, most of all, Te Wiata, who delivers a truly award-worthy portrayal. What’s most impressive here, though, is the work of first-time feature filmmaker Stewart-Te Whiu, a promising new voice in the field whose initial release bodes well for a bright big screen future. Indeed, “We Were Dangerous” is one of those delightful arthouse gems that has largely flown under the radar but has quietly earned a well-deserved reputation as the inspiring work of a new talent who has managed to successfully knock it out of the park on her first try. Catch this one in limited theatrical release or online; otherwise, report to the matron immediately.",8.0
1194985,Drive Back Home,"Road trip/buddy movies are one of my favorite film genres, primarily because of the myriad possibilities they afford for pairing up unlikely traveling companions journeying together under diverse, unexpected and often-outlandish conditions. And, when filmmakers figure out how to make the most out of these scenarios, their finished products are often entertaining, enlightening, and, above all, engaging. That’s very much the case with writer-director Michael Clowater’s debut feature, an insightful, sensitive, funny and touching story of two very different brothers on an unanticipated road trip through Eastern Canada. In this fact-based story set in 1970, Weldon (Charlie Creed-Miles), a cantankerous, blue collar plumber from small town New Brunswick, learns that his long-estranged gay brother, Perley (Alan Cumming), has been arrested on a morals charge for public indecency in Toronto. Authorities offer Weldon an opportunity to bail out his sibling, with all charges dropped, as long as he agrees to retrieve him and return him to his rustic, far-removed hometown, essentially taking him off the hands of the local police. However, the alternative, if Weldon declines the offer, is a five-year jail sentence for Perley, an outcome he has difficulty justifying, especially when his spry, elderly mother (Clare Coulter) assertively shames him into rescuing her baby, a request driven by her desire to make amends for regrettable considerations tied to the family’s past. Despite his obvious discomfort with the nature of this venture, not to mention the many inherent inconveniences involved in this 1,000-mile road trip in an old, unreliable pickup truck, Weldon relents and makes the drive to the big city to collect his brother. And, after a somewhat adversarial reunion, they set out on the return trip to their collective roots, a prospect Perley doesn’t particularly relish for a variety of reasons. Their challenge-filled journey is subsequently filled with an array of ups and downs, laughs and arguments, and more than a few recollections and revelations, developments that test the relationship of the two mismatched siblings. But, these conditions aside, the result is a tender, redemptive yet sometimes-trying reconciliation as they make their way back to New Brunswick and a very uncertain future. While a few of the sequences are a tad stretched out, they nearly always achieve their intended objectives, providing viewers with an involving, delightfully whimsical but sometimes-dark tale that’s sure to please, tug at the heartstrings, and shine a bright light on their respective issues, failings and awakenings. This is made possible to a great extent by the outstanding performances and character development of the two leads, whose deftly developed chemistry feels completely natural and never forced. But, perhaps most importantly, as with most successful road trip films, “Drive Back Home” effectively shows how disparate personalities can grow and evolve over time through an eventful shared experience, even among those who start out with differing, even antagonistic, outlooks on one other’s lives and circumstances. This release is easily one of the best offerings to come out of this year’s Reeling Festival, a movie undeniably worth one’s time.",9.0

That's what Amber seeks to find out as he travels the breadth of this tiny Himalayan kingdom, bi-annually, trying to ascertain just how it's citizens feel about things. Using a combination of tools, he chats with residents old and new, urban and rural, traditional and more modern - all with a view of establishing just how the population feel and feeding that back to a government that wants to listen and learn about those attitudes to help keep it's folks in a good place - mentally and physically. This documentary introduces us to a range of individuals whose aspirations vary considerably - sometimes depending on age, ability, location, education/vocational abilities - but mostly you are left with a sense of their appreciation of their surroundings. Even though their livelihoods might be seen by the West as more basic, agrarian, undeveloped; their own perception of their existence high in the mountains with beautiful scenery, fresh air and the blessings of their Gods upon them seems to offer that elusive sense of less being more and fulfilment. Obviously not everyone is deliriously happy, but there is a distinct lack of ""clamouring"" for change as the respect for the King and status quo seems to permeate all demographics screaming it ain't broke, so don't fix it. There are quite a few characters here, some more entertaining and a few downright curmudgeonly, and Amber sometimes has his work cut out for him trying to get meaningful answers to his questions so he can extrapolate the data usefully.

It's manipulative in several ways. 

1. At the crucial moment in the film, you're left in the dark as to what really happened, only so that you can have the ""suspense"" of waiting to find out a long time later, when you're past caring. 
2. There are many shots taken from behind the main actress' head, but what is in focus is - the back of her head! With everything else blurred. An innovative technique for those enamoured of watching the back of people's heads.

1103167,得寵先生,"Lawrence Cheng is the irritable ""Kai"", an elderly gent who has just retired from his job and looks forward to a life where he will just be left in peace. It seems that he is not to have his wish though, as he is constantly pestered by a lively brown dog called ""Roasted Piggy""! When it polishes off some of his dinner, he takes a water hose to it and is spotted by doggy-do-gooder ""Una"" (Amy Low) who scolds him for his treatment of the thieving hound. Initially, he's no more interested in her opinion than the dog's, but gradually he begins to warm to the beast as it shows a grim determination to save him from himself. Meantime, ""Una"" is having a pretty torrid time between trying to save all the strays she finds and dealing with her loved-up colleague (Jay Fung) who wants them to relocate to Edinburgh and get married. Perhaps they can set up a sanctuary there? There's certainly something of the ""Greyfriar's Bobby"" to ""Roasted Piggy"". Just to add a little intrigue to this increasingly soapy drama, someone is putting out food for the dogs laced with poison. Can this unlikely pairing unite to save the dogs from this new menace? The amiable Cheng is on good form here as the cantankerous old git who thinks his productive life is done, but the rest of the film rather predictably contrives to introduce the usual elements of familial discord to the plot with his broken marriage, strained relations with his daughter (Fish Liew) and once the grumpiness abates the whole thing becomes just a bit too earnestly familiar. Dog lovers (I""m not) will probably enjoy it more as the story presents them as potent surrogates compensating for lack of human affection in the life of ""Kai"" and ""Una"", and there are some moments of both fun and sadness - just not enough of these really help this film stand out from the pack.",7.0
1102390,Der Spatz im Kamin,"To be blunt, I really dislike arthouse films that give the genre a bad name, yet writer-director Ramon Zürcher’s third feature outing regrettably does just that. This pretentious, meandering exercise in allegedly profound cinema falls flat shortly after it begins and never recovers, growing ever more pointless, unfocused and self-important as it unfolds. Set in the rural childhood home of two very different and quietly combative sisters (Maren Eggert, Britta Hammelstein), the film follows the events associated with a birthday celebration involving the siblings and their families. As the festivities (if they can be called that) begin to play out, however, it quickly becomes apparent that this party will go anything but smoothly given its cast of largely reprehensible characters, nearly all of whom utter their hate-filled insults with stoically deadpan monotone delivery. This examination of a seriously troubled family, in turn, increasingly draws heavily from “The Big Book of Domestic Dysfunctional Drama,” with virtually every character possessing a crippling physical and/or psychological disorder, qualities that shape their pervasively ugly demeanors. This hodgepodge of elements is thus employed in a futile attempt to build some type of cohesive narrative, presumably in an effort to depict the descent into madness. But this goal is never adequately realized, thanks in large part to a wealth of superficial, pedestrian dialogue that tries mightily to pass itself off as enigmatically “meaningful” and several preposterous surreal segments that are all show and no substance, sequences that resemble scenes out of “Carrie” (1976) or “Firestarter” (1984) if those films had been directed by Ingmar Bergman. And, no matter how much the filmmaker seeks to cover up these innate weaknesses by embellishing them with stunning still life cinematography, the strains of atmospheric classical music and long, lingering facial close-ups, the overall mix of elements just doesn’t work, growing progressively more muddled, laughable and tedious as this tiresome offering wears on…and on…and on. To make matters worse, though, the film also incorporates some positively repugnant images, such as a young woman slicing up her bloody hand on a cheese grater and a cat being locked into a washing machine that’s subsequently switched on, a shamefully disgusting sequence that’s wholly uncalled for, regardless of how simulated it may have been. It’s beyond me how this disastrous project got the green light to begin with, but this is handily one of the worst films of 2024, one that doesn’t deserve whatever attention and accolades it may erroneously garner.",1.0
1095805,武替道,"Action director Sam Lee (Stephen Tung) always prioritized making a good and memorable film over the well-being of his crew. In the 1980s, while filming a scene that required a stuntman to jump off a bridge onto a moving truck, Sam’s directing skills couldn’t save an accident from happening, and a stuntman was paralyzed.

In the modern day, Sam has turned to physical therapy and odd jobs to help out friends. He’s contacted by Cho (Yen To), a veteran director that Sam used to work with. Cho is making a film with international megastar Wai (Philip Ng), who began his career as a part of Sam’s stunt team.

For his final film, Cho is returning to his roots and wants to make an action film that is in the 1980s style. Despite Wai’s reluctance, Cho brings in Sam to be the film’s action director. Sam enlists a rookie stuntman named Lee Sai-long (Terrance Lau) to be his action coordinator. What transpires is not only a clashing of the classic and modern styles, but the difficulty of adapting to the times.

Long has been struggling to find work as a stuntman, even though it has been his dream. Long’s brother Kit (Max Cheung) wants him to stop wasting his life and start working with him in his delivery business. Sam’s daughter Cherry (Cecilia Choi) is getting married. Their relationship is strained because Sam always prioritized movies over Cherry and her mother, who ended up leaving Sam over his actions one fateful evening. Sam being included in Cherry’s wedding is a courtesy on her part, as she’s mostly waiting for him to blow it.

The opening action sequence of the film takes place in a mall and seems to be heavily inspired by Jackie Chan’s Police Story. The conversation where Cho convinces Sam to be a part of the film occurs while Sam stares at the famous bronze Bruce Lee statue in Hong Kong. Stephen Tung shared a scene with Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon, so this was the Leung Brothers (the directors), Albert and Herbert, way of honoring that.  

Stuntman is interesting in the sense that so much of the film is devoted to action films and action sequences, but it’s more of a drama film overall. What The Fall Guy did to honor American stuntmen, Stuntman does for Hong Kong cinema. The film emphasizes the importance of timing in action scenes and touches on what goes into action preparation.

Hong Kong cinema is dying in the modern day, and there is less and less work for stuntmen because those types of films just aren’t being made anymore. Sam is semi-retired at the start of the film. He didn’t turn his back on the business, but he believes he’ll never be able to make another film as an action director again.

What was done in the 1980s cannot be done today. Sam finds that out the hard way when he decides to shoot a robbery sequence in broad daylight around civilians in the middle of the city without permits. The film is a clash of the young and old just as much as it is a transition from the classic to the modern. Stunt teams of today aren’t willing to put their bodies on the line for just any sequence, let alone the entire film. Meanwhile, everyone on set knows who Sam is or has worked with him in some capacity. So they don’t want to make the same mistakes.

The film is overrun with strained relationships. Sam has burned bridges with the action film community as well as his relationship with his daughter, but he’s been given these chances that he hasn’t earned. Long and his brother Kit also butt heads since Long wants to follow his dream if given the opportunity, while Kit is blinded by what’s convenient and is currently financially stable.

Sam can visualize stunts even in the most claustrophobic of places, and he has a reputation for making brilliant films. His daughter owns a pottery store, and at the encouragement of Long, Sam poorly makes a pot for her. The pot is shoddy, and he has to remake it over and over again throughout the film, but the way it keeps breaking and being put back together or remolded symbolizes his attempts to repair his relationship with Cherry.

Sam’s redemption arc isn’t earned in the film. The final sequence is memorable and a hell of a way to end the film, but Sam doesn’t learn much of anything throughout the film. He still prioritizes his career in movies over anything else, and he barely apologizes for being an asshole or any mistake he’s made to any of the people he supposedly cares about. He’s given countless opportunities and throws everyone under the bus every chance he gets, just because someone changes something for the movie he was involved with.

Stuntman is an action film that embraces the new while honoring the legends that came before it. Sam’s life is a trainwreck, and he destroys every project and every friendship that’s thrown at him, but he delivers cinematic magic every time. With exceptionally poignant performances and a traumatic snowball of a storyline that builds and builds until everything around Sam explodes, Stuntman walks hand in hand with Jackie Chan’s Ride On as emotional excellence when it comes to Hong Kong films centered around stuntmen.",8.0
1080658,Gassed Up,"""Ash"" (Stephen Odubola) lives at home with his young sister and his permanently absent or stoned mother. His dream is to start a business of his own (he likes to fix things) and to get her into rehab. To that end he's mixed up with four of his mates in a snatch 'n grab scheme using mopeds to pinch mobile phones and handbags from unsuspecting folks on the street. They sell these on to ""Shaz"" (Jelena Gavrilovic) who happens to be the cousin of the gang's leader ""Dubz"" (Taz Skylar). ""Ash"" finds the shoebox under his bed is gradually filling up, but when he's told his mother's medical costs are likely to run to £25,000 he realises that nicking a few phones ain't going cut it. After a raid to get themselves some new transport goes awry, with one of their number a bit too handy with the spray-on acid, they are reduced to four and given a new task. Rob a jewellery store and make some proper money. When this goes tragically wrong, ""Ash"" and his pals ""Kabz"" (Mohammed Mansaray) and ""Mole"" (Tobias Jowett) have to persuade their briefly ostracised mate ""Roach"" (Craige Middleburg) to come back and help them - because their paymasters are still demanding a sackful of loot! Up until this point, the film is actually quite decent - a diverse group of life-long mates all carrying out what they reckon are victimless crimes to make some cash. Once the violent elements kick in, though, the plot really heads south. What made it a bit different is subsumed into a rather amateurishly directed affair with implausible police chases, even more unlikely robbery scenarios and just one chunk too much of bad decision making - on and off the screen. Skylar is a man with charisma, but the rest of these characters never light up the screen or the story and by the sequel-suggesting conclusion, I'd sort of lost interest. It is worth a watch with all the ""life's there for the taking"" stuff going on, but it'll be on the television soon enough and I'm sure it can wait til then.",6.0
1080658,Gassed Up,"Most certainly not perfect, I'm not convinced by it I won't lie, but... <em>'Gassed Up'</em> narrowly does enough.

Making your lead characters criminals is always a brave choice, you're almost setting yourself up for failure from a film point of view. I'm personally cool with a movie's main lot not being total good guys, like <em>'The Fast and the Furious'</em> is literally one of my favourite flicks ever, but it does make it more difficult to root for the people onscreen.

In this execution of making the audience do the aforementioned, I think this film doesn't do the best job. I appreciate the backstory we get for them, well at least for a few of them, and it does work in making you understand their point of views. However, I'm just not sure if it's enough to overcome what the characters are actually doing; it's not like they are Robin Hoods... well, I guess they actually are robin hoods (ha! get it! sorry!) but you get what I mean.

There's also an inconsistency in that they avoid going up a level in their activities as they know it'll bring more heat - yet not long after stating that they brazenly take it up a notch anyway. A possible 'out' is they are blinded by wonga but that's unconvincing. All this is just me saying that the writing isn't the best, in my opinion of course.

What does save this is that the feel of the film is competent, it's fairly well put together and moves along at a decent pace. The cast are also positives, with Stephen Odubola being the clear standout as Ash. Taz Skylar and Mohammed Mansaray are alright, though Craige Middleburg and Mae Muller (strange casting for the latter) are more miss than hit. I would've liked Steve Toussaint to have been used more.

Glad I watched this at the cinema though, always nice to support productions from the homeland. Two groups of two were in there with me, though one duo did decide to leave with a good chunk of the movie left; I see other reviewers have noted likewise  - ouch! I can possibly see why if I'm totally truthful, but for me I just about got enough out of it. I could easily be rating this a step lower, though.",7.0
1066124,Chuck Chuck Baby,"""Helen"" (Louise Brealy) wakes up in the morning in what looks like a bedsit, with a suitcase of her meagre possessions tucked under the mattress. A chubby chav walks in on her and we discover that this is, in fact, her husband ""Gary"" (Celyn Jones) who has banished her to the spare room so he can live with his teeny-pop girlfriend ""Amy"" (Emily Fairn) and their brand new baby. Needless to say, she's not an happy woman but she puts up with all of this so she can stay close to his ailing mother ""Gwen"" (Sorcha Cusack) who's bedridden and clearly not too long for this world. Her only real moments of joy come from her work. She works with a tightly knit group of women packing chickens. The routine mundanity of that job leads the four of them to play daft games and try to chivvy each other along to alleviate the boredom - especially on a nightshift! Then a bit of a bombshell arrives in the form of ""Joanne"" (Annabel Scholey). Despite a rather frosty reunion, it's obvious that there is some baggage between these two women and the rest of the film infills some of the backstory of both women augmented by some frequently laugh out loud comedy. The principal culprit of the humour is ""Paula"" (Beverly Rudd) - rough around the edges but with an heart of gold and some of the best lines from an entertainingly written script. The plot is fairly predictable, though auteur Janis Pugh does throw a few spanners in the works to keep it interesting, and there are some semi-musical theatre style numbers as the story occasionally uses it's decent soundtrack to advance the story - usually to epitomise the unhappiness of ""Helen"". It's well cast with a solid supporting effort, a tiny bit of social commentary and a rather queazy rapport between the girls and one of those plastic heads kids used to used to practice their make-up skills on. It could also serve as a pretty good advert for never eating chickens - the things these women get up to plucking these birds could put you off for ever!",7.0
1027261,O Clube das Mulheres de Negócios,"When a film tries to cover too much territory, it’s often doomed to failure. And such is the case with writer-director Anna Muylaert’s latest feature offering, a picture with an intriguing premise that ultimately doesn’t know where it’s trying to go or what it’s trying to say. This wildly meandering, supremely unfocused (alleged) dark comedy tells the tale of an exclusive São Paulo country club run by women that has fallen on hard times. To prop up the facility’s reputation, the club’s president (Cristina Pereira) arranges to have what she believes to be a puff piece written about it by a neophyte journalist (Rafael Vitti) (who just happens to be her grandson), accompanied by the images of a renowned photographer (Luis Miranda). On the day of the interviews for the article, the organization’s board members assemble at the club, where viewers soon learn that virtually all of them are polished but greedy, unsavory, unprincipled individuals who try to do whatever it takes to protect their reputations – and to stay out of jail. But, in the midst of all this intrigue and subterfuge, all hell breaks loose when three of the president’s pet jaguars escape from their confines at the club and begin running rampant throughout the property. This is where the film falls apart, turning silly, directionless, inconsistent and gratuitous as everyone scrambles to protect their own hides from creatures depicted with some of the worst CGI effects I’ve seen since the overhyped Bollywood spectacle “RRR” (2022). What’s more, unexplained (and ultimately unresolved) story threads emerge from this narrative chaos. In many respects, the film tries to adopt a metaphorically satirical approach in a less-than-successful attempt at making statements about Brazilian politics, government, business and society, with scathing though obvious criticisms about its hypocritical religious practices and inept environmental policies. And then there are this offering’s strangely handled gender aspects. This is most notable in its ubiquitous presentation of inexplicably androgynous, weak-willed males and women who have made misogyny an artform, elements that send questionably disempowering (some might even say woefully inappropriate) messages to viewers, despite the comeuppance experienced by those associated with such behavior. From this, it’s thus easy to see how this is an unduly overstuffed production that comes across as more muddle than riddle and undermines what could have been an engaging premise if better handled. Put simply, this one is a cinematic mess that’s easily passed over.",
1025313,Penal Cordillera,"When right-wing Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was ousted from office in 1990, five of his henchmen (fanatical military officers charged with doing the autocrat’s dirty work) were sentenced to incarceration for terms totaling hundreds of years at a special “prison” at the base of the Andes Mountains. The facility was far more comfortable than a typical penitentiary, where the now-aged egomaniacal inmates enjoyed comparatively more freedom and privileges than what typical prisoners experienced and where the guards were more like domestic servants than corrections officers. While the residents often complained about their accommodations – far less lavish than what they were accustomed to – they had it relatively easy given what they had done and were now being “punished” for. In fact, in many respects, they still called the shots, despite the presence of supposed state authorities overseeing their “confinement.”  Director Felipe Carmona chronicles the unconventional circumstances of the inmates and staff in this fact-based account of their waning days “behind bars,” circa 2013. However, their story is anything but easy to follow, featuring a narrative that’s all over the map with little coherency connecting the various segments and story threads. Conflicting cinematic styles (including some that are almost surreal in nature and others that are downright silly, such as a sequence shot in the style of an old-time black-and-white silent movie), along with themes that seldom feel fully fleshed out, seriously bog down the overall flow of the story, leaving viewers more confused than enlightened by the time the credits roll. Admittedly, as a picture made for Chilean audiences, there likely are a number of nuanced elements whose significance becomes lost in translation, but, even setting that consideration aside, “Prison in the Andes” simply is not well assembled as a cogent cinematic offering. I’ve seen more than my share of Chilean movies over the years, including a variety of releases related to the Pinochet regime during its heyday and in the aftermath of its fall from power, but this muddled release definitely isn’t one of them.",4.0
1013776,The Grab,"Sometimes a story is so big and involved that it’s difficult to get a handle on it. That can be quite a challenge for even the most adept documentarians and investigative reporters, no matter how eager or adept they may be in taking on such an ambitious project. And that, unfortunately, is the case with the latest offering from director Gabriela Cowperthwaite in her eight-year-long collaboration with journalist Nathan Halverson of The Center for Investigative Reporting. In essence, the film seeks to identify and characterize the new flashpoints underlying emerging geopolitical conflicts. Just as those in recent years have been driven by the compulsion to secure valuable energy supplies, today’s budding battlegrounds are once again tied to acquiring access to precious resources – in this case, food and water, along with the aquifers, agricultural land and processing facilities needed to yield these commodities. Evidence of the desperate, growing need for obtaining these materials has already begun to surface – albeit not always overtly – in such incidents as the Arab Spring and even the War in Ukraine. And, because of this developing crisis, those interested in locking down these resources have started scrambling to acquire them, primarily clandestinely, in regions where they’re most plentiful. These efforts have been spearheaded by multinational corporations and global financial institutions in cooperation with countries that are experiencing, or have historically experienced, critical food and water shortages, such as China, Russia, Venezuela and the nations of the Middle East. And, to help ensure the success of these ventures, they have enlisted the support of mercenary muscle to achieve their goals. High-profile targets, primarily in Africa and even parts of the US, have come under growing scrutiny, unscrupulously grabbed from their rightful owners and leaving them destitute as a result. Needless to say, this is an incredibly complicated story, one that’s difficult to tell, and, regrettably, that’s somewhat apparent in the finished product. While the work of Cowperthwaite and Halverson is undoubtedly sincere, having brought a great deal of previously buried information to light, it’s nearly impossible to relate this complex narrative in a concise and coherent manner. Given the many story threads involved and the well-camouflaged structures that have been set up to keep the truth and its principal participants concealed, it’s a genuine challenge to intelligibly expose the overarching nature of this highly convoluted big picture. Some elements are thus underdeveloped or left incomplete, making this film an often-frustrating watch. That’s unfortunate considering the importance of this story, one that has been largely flying below the radar and certainly deserves to be more widely exposed and detailed. With that said, though, “The Grab” represents a valuable start, and one can only hope there will be more releases like this that manage to dig deeper and discover more. It’s also heartening that the picture addresses some of the victories that have come about in combatting this issue, particularly those that have benefitted Africans who have been subjected to what is essentially a new form of continental colonization. In an age where increasing social and political volatility is arising due to a failure to effectively address the world’s hunger, it’s essential that we become aware of this issue before it gets out of hand and leads us down a path we don’t dare pursue.",6.0

1252182,Pod wulkanem,"Irony can provide both spice and substance to a story when blended with skill and dexterity. But, if that mix is off, the narrative can fall apart quickly, as happens, unfortunately, in this offering that draws from headlines of the recent past. Writer-director Damian Kocur’s second feature outing focuses on the experiences of a Ukrainian family of four on vacation in the Canary Islands. But, just as they’re preparing to board their flight back to Kyiv, they learn of the invasion of their homeland by marauding Russian forces, and, with the breakout of hostilities, they’re left stranded on Tenerife. The irony in this is that, while things are falling apart in Ukraine, they’re not only safe, but also in a beautiful island paradise. They’re even extended free meals and accommodations by their resort hotel for as long as needed until they’re able to make arrangements to return home or find sanctuary in a secure location. But how can they realistically enjoy themselves, even under conditions as pleasant as these, with so much uncertainty hanging over them? Indeed, what does their future hold? The stress of this situation soon leads to all manner of conflict among family members, not to mention tense relations with other guests (particularly in encounters with vacationers from Russia), as their lives take on a metaphorical warzone quality of their own. On the surface, this might sound like an intriguing premise for a film, especially in light of its contemporary relevance. And, for a while, it works. However, the picture steadily runs out of steam – and material. About 45 minutes into the film, the story begins to lose its way, meandering aimlessly with no apparent direction and unable to effectively hold viewer interest. In essence, the filmmaker loses control of the room as his production limps along toward its unceremonious conclusion. Over the remainder of the film, an array of domestic conflicts and redundant footage of ocean waves crashing onto the island’s shoreline come to dominate the visuals, symbolism that becomes a little too obvious and repetitive after a while. The irony that provided the foundation of the picture fades away, as little is done to make effective use of it, replaced with trite, recurring imagery and an utter lack of focus. It’s truly a shame that this release couldn’t find the means to sustain itself throughout its runtime. Had it done so, this might have been one of the more engaging and insightful productions to have come out of late. Instead, the result is a vehicle that’s ultimately as deflating as the circumstances surrounding it.",4.0

1234598,Drużyna A(A),"Confronting our personal demons might seem like a scary prospect, but sometimes it’s the most effective way to deal with them – to tackle them head on and get over them, one would hope, once and for all. Such is the case for four recovering alcoholics (Danuta Stenka, Maria Sobocinska, Michal Zurawski, Mikolaj Kubacki) facing the prospect of their treatment center being shut down due to a lack of funds. However, a way out of this dilemma becomes available when one of them (Zurawski) learns of an opportunity to raise quick cash by transporting two tanker truckloads of illegal (and stolen) vodka across Poland to a waiting buyer, payment for which they plan to use for keeping their treatment facility up and running. The question is, can the foursome resist the temptation presented by their cargo in carrying out this dubious task? And, even if so, can they stay ahead of the ruthless mobster (Magdalena Cielecka) whose liquor was pilfered and now wants it back, no matter what the cost? Thus begins the start of an adventure-filled road trip by this ragtag quartet, accompanied by their unwittingly kidnapped therapist (Lukasz Simlat), who’s brought along to help keep them sober and stable during their upcoming journey. In the course of their odyssey, however, the amateur bootleggers come up against the ghosts of their past, the people and circumstances that prompted them to start binging in the first place, challenges that make their ability to resist the temptations around them even greater. Can they succeed under conditions like these? Though billed as a dark comedy, director Daniel Jaroszek’s sophomore effort is more of a drama with comic relief than a raucously funny offering, and, even though the laughs are genuine and well earned, there are so few of them that they almost come across as being out of place. What’s more, the film overall is far too long; its 2:12:00 runtime could have easily been pared back considerably without losing much. In addition, the filmmaker’s mix of moods, filming styles and storytelling devices is so eclectic that it’s often difficult for viewers to determine exactly what kind of vibe he’s going for. This hodgepodge of elements – though skillfully executed individually – just don’t seem like they belong together in the same picture. This raises the possibility that the director is trying to show off what he’s capable of – a page out of the “look, Ma, no hands” school of filmmaking – never minding the fact that continuity is sacrificed in the process. To be sure, “The A(A) Team” reveals a talent with considerable potential but who also has a serious need to settle down and learn when to contain those abilities, especially when it comes to the question of knowing when “to kill one’s darlings.” In all fairness, the picture features some fine performances and cinematography, as well as thoughtful and sensitive treatment of its subject matter, never coming across flippantly, which it easily could have if left in less skillful hands. Nevertheless, the overall production still feels like a filmed version of the first draft of a script concept, and, on that score, it definitely could have used some work to bring the picture up to where it might have been.",5.0

1172091,Wilding,"There's something quite fascinating about the recuperative ability of the land to recover from centuries of man's abuse displayed in this documentary. Isabella Tree and husband Charlie have inherited a country estate that can barely manage to grow weeds. The soil is knackered and desperate action is required. They hit on the fairly radical idea of abandoning the place to nature (except their front lawn!) and the film now follows the reclamation of this space by birds, bugs, deer, pigs, cattle - creatures that would have roamed the land freely a few hundred years ago. They even bring in storks! It's a stunning piece of photography to look at, but the underlying narrative is really quite weak and I found it allowed sentiment to overrule the one thing it fails to address - scalability. They live in a castle with no evident money worries. None that we are told about, anyway. So this looks like a worthy pet project that though laudable and impressive will, as one of their neighbours raises at a meeting, not feed the nation. When the vast majority of these complementary farming techniques were in use, the population of the UK was probably less than 10% of what it is now; malnutrition and starvation were rife and distribution methods, without refrigeration, left the food supply subject to the vagaries of the weather. What this doesn't address in any way is just how this method of nurturing the land is going to provide for an hungry population. It's largely presented by Isabella Tree herself, and she is an engaging individual but one who presents the most complex of arguments in far too simple a fashion - as if it were a lecture on the relative merits of organic methods without addressing in any way their limitations of their practicalities or economics. ""Duncan"" the horse and a few of the pigs have some great fun at a charity polo match and it is a very watchable film - but a little too light and fluffy.",7.0
1139878,The Becomers,"Can polished, entertaining sci-fi effectively be delivered on a shoestring budget and under a tight shooting schedule? If writer-director Zach Clark’s “The Becomers” is any indication, the answer is a resounding “yes.” Add to this ambitious mix a sharply written story and script, skillful film editing, an innate quirkiness, a wry satirical bent and inventive, impeccably timed humor, and viewers have got a top-notch, quasi-campy sci-fi comedy on their hands, one well worth the watch. The filmmaker’s latest tells the story of a pair of star-crossed alien lovers who manage to escape their dying planet and come to Earth but are now desperately trying to find one another once again. It can be a challenge given their unfamiliarity with the ways of their new home, as well as their inescapable need to regularly appropriate (albeit, somewhat surprisingly, seemingly innocently) the bodies of human hosts (think a far less menacing, more sentimental version of “Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” with its inherently grim events supported, ironically, by a sweet, but unusual, and certainly undeniable love story). Eventually, however, the differences between the two worlds invariably catch up with the duo, with their frequent (and often-improvised and opportunistic) switches involving them in an array of diverse scenarios populated by such characters as a woman in the process of giving birth, a cult of radical (but politically and spiritually oriented reformist) terrorists, and a corrupt high-ranking politician and his largely dysfunctional family. In telling this tale, the film serves up a big platter of laughs (some guilty pleasure-level goofy, others supremely witty and genuinely inspired), accompanied by ample introspections into such topics as gender and racial identity, the undeserved clout of crooked government officials, the metaphysics behind the nature of “being,” and the complicated relationship between survival and remorse, not to mention a whole lot about love. And it’s all topped off by a fine, obviously tight-knit acting ensemble, many of whose members’ roles don’t necessarily require much from them, but all of whom play their parts in ways that elevate them to unexpected levels of excellence and eloquence, more than one might ordinarily expect from a movie in this genre. That’s quite a list of achievements for a low-cost indie production of any kind, let alone one with the more demanding budget requirements and constraints typically associated with science fiction releases. But that’s where this picture’s production crew has really risen to the occasion by devising simple yet innovative ways to dazzle without breaking the bank, a brilliant accomplishment. If I had any reservation about this film, it would probably be that it’s a little slow to get rolling, but that’s more than made up for by the overall quality of this offering. If you enjoy quality filmmaking made up of the foregoing elements, you owe it to yourself to catch this one (preferably on a big screen, if possible). Like me, you’ll probably come away from it pleasantly surprised for what it delivers – not to mention encouraged by impressively illustrating what the film industry can achieve when it earnestly puts its mind to it.",8.0
1085492,Layla,"When ""Layla"" (Bilal Hasna) dons the full drag regalia to perform at a corporate launch for some ready meal company and they pay her in vouchers, she isn't best pleased and so makes a speech annoying just about everyone in the room except the guy from the marketing company. He's ""Max"" (Louis Greatorex) and it's quite clear that there's a little chemistry between the two after a brief conversation on a stairwell. It's not long before they've hooked up and what's clear is that both are attracted to the other, but that both have their identification issues that might prove difficult for the other to reconcile. The question for each of them is the extent to which they can love each other and still be who they are, want or need to be. Now perhaps it's the old romantic in me, but I hated the ending. That may be, though, because it is truthful and didn't take any easy routes out of what is quite an interesting story of human nurture, nature and personality. The former man is from Surrey, but has Arab roots whilst ""Max"" is as white as chalk and way more conforming to the more standard British norms of dress and family. Both are openly gay so that's not the issue, it's much more about breaking free from those linear and societal boundaries and being true to themselves. If I'm honest, I didn't much care for the drag friends. They seemed determined that ""Max"" was always going to be an interloper, and most of us know that embryonic relationships - platonic or sexual - can often thrive or fail depending on the reaction existing friends provide. There's quite a bit of selfishness around here and that annoyed me a little. Both performances are honest, playful and at times quite visceral and though comparisons are bound to be made with ""Femme"" and/or ""Unicorns"" from last year, this has quite an unique take on issues that are specific to those two characters here, but needn't be looked at in isolation.",7.0
1078806,In Camera,"The camera clearly loves Nabhaan Rizwan in this quirky tale of would-be actor ""Aden"" who spends most of his life travelling from audition to photo-shoot then back to an audition without ever getting a call back.

He shares a flat with the permanently over-tired doctor ""Bo"" (Rory Fleck Byrne) but maybe things could pick up with their debonaire new sharer ""Conrad"" (Amir El-Masry) shows up. Might his luck be about to improve? Or - might our friend have taken a bit of a leap into an alternate reality where his sub-conscious has started to change the repetitive dynamic of his life from one of repeated rejection to one of potential. By mid-way through, it's not at all clear to us just what is real and what might not be - and it's quite a bamboozling feeling to have! Rizwan brings some charisma to his frustrated role, certainly, and there's some genuinely funny moments to be taken from his increasing despondency, but somehow I found the whole thing just a bit too disjointed and the characterisations undercooked. He is obviously a British-Asian, but are his experiences seeking success with his chosen career likely to be any less disappointing that anyone from a different background/ethnicity? I'm assuming 99% of people who embark on this sort of path end up working on tables and only ever see the bright lights of their shaving mirror? If it's trying to illustrate a complex sense of anxiety and it's consequences, then it misses completely, I'm afraid. Why should we care about the self-inflicted misery of a great looking man who could just easily go and do something else? Though I did like the exploratory premiss that director Naqqash Khalid is trying to take, I just felt too much was left undeveloped. It's worth a watch, and I'm sure we will see more from both the leading creatives here - but this one, I'm not sure I will remember for long.",6.0
1030282,All Happy Families,"Movie portrayals of family life often leave much to be desired when it comes to authenticity (especially for offerings on the Hallmark Channel). So it’s genuinely refreshing when a film comes along that depicts these stories with honesty while being eminently entertaining at the same time. Such is the case with writer-director Haroula Rose’s second feature outing about a Chicago family going through a variety of transitions that become ironically (and often hilariously) interconnected, all served up with sparkling wit and an excellent array of one-liners that are definite zingers without being hurtful or nasty. The construction of the narrative and its accompanying screenplay are meticulous and economical, moving along with a steadily sustained pace and never getting bogged down by prolonged sequences that languish or lose their zest, much in the style of director Nicole Holofcener’s works. All of this is brought to life by a finely assembled ensemble cast, especially its four principals (Josh Radnor, Rob Huebel, John Ashton and Becky Ann Baker) but also in its palette of intriguing supporting players. What’s more, the film does a superb job in its depiction of Chicago’s people and neighborhoods, presenting an authentic look and feel of the Windy City, one that residents of the Second City will relish and appreciate. “All Happy Families” is one of those offerings that aren’t widely seen (or made) any more, but it’s one of the best I’ve screened in a long time.

943745,American Trash,"My quick rating - 6.1/10. When I got an email from Robert LaSardo himself asking me to check out his directorial debut American Trash, my jaw hit the floor. This is a guy I’ve been rooting for since the early ’90s, back when he’d pop up just long enough to get thrown through a window by Steven Seagal. But over the years, I watched him evolve, especially with roles like Gang Related, where it became clear LaSardo was a lot more than just a tough guy with tattoos. Now, stepping behind the camera for the first time, he delivers a raw and surprisingly vulnerable story about grief, trauma, and the crumbling environment we call society.

Set in a dystopian vision of Los Angeles, American Trash is not your typical revenge flick, despite what the synopsis might suggest. Don’t come in expecting Milles Carpis (LaSardo) to go full Rambo on everyone after his lover is murdered. This is not that movie. What you get instead is a slow-burn, emotionally driven journey through despair, healing, and introspection. Milles, drowning in pain, leans on a group of modern-day hippies for guidance. Yeah, it sounds a bit out there—but it works. Surprisingly well.

LaSardo’s performance is, as expected, rock-solid. But what really caught me off guard was his ability to direct emotion. There are a few quiet, atmospheric scenes—one in particular comes to mind, where Milles sits isolated amid a tribute—that hit harder than any bullet or explosion. You really feel the loneliness, the absence, and the weight of unresolved grief. It’s in these moments that the film shines.

Now, I’m not sure that listening to old Charles Manson tapes is the healthiest way to cope with the loss of a loved one, but hey, this is American Trash. It’s messy, it’s dark, and it doesn’t always make the most sensible choices—but grief rarely does either. The film explores PTSD, environmental collapse, and the ripple effect of tragedy in a way that feels surprisingly honest. It’s a love story, yes, but it’s also a lesson in the quiet destruction caused by emotional neglect, both personal and societal.

The film isn’t without its flaws. It’s uneven in pacing at times, and some scenes feel like they linger a bit too long on abstract imagery when the story would’ve benefited from a firmer hand. But as a debut, it’s impressive. LaSardo proves he’s more than ready to move beyond bit parts and supporting roles—he has something to say, and now he has a platform to say it.

American Trash is a moody, meditative, and grounded tale that focuses more on emotional consequence than action-packed closure. It may not be for everyone, but if you give it a chance, there’s something real beneath the grime and chaos. And for a first-time director, LaSardo shows that he knows exactly what he’s doing. He just chooses to do it a bit differently.

797223,युध्रा,"Yudhra is an action-packed film featuring Siddhant Chaturvedi as a young man grappling with anger issues stemming from a traumatic past. My experience watching it was a rollercoaster of intense action and emotional moments, though the film ultimately felt uneven.

The cinematography and action sequences are visually impressive, showcasing well-choreographed stunts that kept me engaged. Siddhant's portrayal of Yudhra is commendable; he effectively embodies the character's rage and vulnerability. However, despite the strong performances, particularly from Malavika Mohanan, their on-screen chemistry felt lacking, which diminished some emotional stakes.

While the first half builds anticipation with intriguing setups, the second half loses momentum and falls into predictability. The story meanders, and I found myself wishing for a more cohesive narrative that could tie the action to deeper emotional arcs. The film's relentless violence may appeal to action enthusiasts, but it often overshadows character development.

Overall, Yudhra offers thrilling moments and a glimpse of potential but ultimately feels like a missed opportunity to deliver a more impactful story. It’s worth watching for action fans, but those seeking a strong narrative may be left wanting more.

1376579,Modest Male Exposure 2: I Dream of Genes,"SUPRISINGLY FUNNY AND ORIGINAL!

I saw this movie at a club in New York City in November 2024.  It was right after the Presidential election and the mood of the whole country was very tense, and everybody was exhausted from the constant political news every day.  I did not know what to expect, except that someone who knew some of the cast told me it was supposed to be hilarious.  They weren't kidding! ""Modest Male Exposure 2"" was just what I needed to escape the ""real"" world.  At first the movie seemed like it was going to be just a series of vignettes, like ""Sex and the City"" except from a male perspective... with a LOT of unexpected full-frontal male nudity.  OMG everybody just seemed really horny in this movie! But then there was a serious plot about the main character who finds out he has a son that he did not know he had from a DNA test. The scenes between the father and the new son were really very sweet. The rest of the audience really seemed to love it too, although I suspect that most of the people there were friends with the cast and the director.  Some scenes were outright hilarious, such as when the father and son first meet in a restaurant, and then when the son hides in the closet and watches his father have sex with another guy's girlfriend...  Overall, highly recommended if you like crazy comedies with a lot of male nudity.",8.0
1376579,Modest Male Exposure 2: I Dream of Genes,"When I first learned there was going to be a sequel to the 2022 short film MODEST MALE EXPOSURE, I was wondering out loud just how long New York City drag queen Clover Welsh (who wrote, directed, and starred in the original movie) and New York City journalist/actor Jed Ryan (who produced and starred in the original) could stretch the first movie's theme of naked men and shifting attitudes towards male modesty. After all, just how much further can you go after you have four penises on the big screen, all competing for attention at the same time? Were they now planning on showing EIGHT penises on screen at the same time?! The short answer is no, although there's certainly no shortage of full-frontal male nudity in this film as well.  Thankfully, this full-length (96 minutes) sequel does actually have a plot-- and a pretty interesting one at that.  In this incarnation, Sam Derrick (Jed Ryan, who write the screenplay and directed) learns that he has a son named Rev from a college fling.  Rev (charmingly played by Jonathan Wong Frye) seems taken aback by the seemingly hedonistic lifestyle of his father-- especially when Sam seduces and ultimately jumps into bed with the girlfriend of a rival rugby player while Rev unwittingly watches from a closet.  The blossoming father-son bond is ultimately put to the test when the pair attend a costume party/presumed orgy called The Devil's Ball, thrown by the mysterious socialite Mistress Windy (Wendy Stuart) who seemingly has some psychic powers.  Without giving too much away, let's just say that things get rather disquieting quite quickly...

Ryan's screenplay is quite funny, with some moments being true comic gold-- particularly a farcical restaurant scene, and a moment later on where a sexy temptress (Rew Starr) seduces both father and son at a party.  While the director gets wobbly performers from some of the cast (It's a little too obvious that Ryan cast his friends in many of the roles.), other actors really get to show their gift of comedy, especially Ike Avelli, Tym Moss, and Mark-Eugene Garcia.  Sabastian Roy is also quite touching as Ari, a rugby player with a secret; Sara Minisquero is equally affecting as his sympathetic girlfriend. Clover Welsh, returning as ""Goldie"", is a hoot in her blindingly loud dress sets and unabashed horniess.  Welsh could easily become the 2025 equivalent of the 1970's sitcom staple Jo Anne Worley: the slightly daffy but still libidinous older woman who isn't afraid to seduce the younger guys.  Still, I can't help but wonder if Clover Welsh and Jed Ryan are just playing thinly veiled versions of themselves.  Let's see what this duo plan to do with the inevitable MODEST MALE EXPOSURE 3...",9.0
1376579,Modest Male Exposure 2: I Dream of Genes,"This movie is like ""Sex and the City"" (or maybe ""And Just Like That"", because everyone in the movie seems to be on the older side)-- but focusing on the male perspective rather than the female perspective. Still, there's a lot of nudity (mostly male) and sex in this movie. There are four main guys: Sam, Trevor, Fred, and Ari... but instead of shopping like in SATC, they are into playing rugby and drinking beer and of course having sex. I really liked the way the movie told each of their stories-- especially the character of Ari, who is a transgendered man who wants to have phalloplasty to ""fit in with the other guys"".  But the main character is Sam. He learns that he has a grown half-Asian son named Rev from a college fling.  The movie shows the father and son bonding with each other in New York City which is really fun to watch-- especially the two women they meet up with in Times Square.  However, things get a little crazy when they go to a party called The Devil's Ball together. A homophobic bouncer thinks they are a gay couple... but then the two get involved in a weird group scene.  The father and son do resolve their misunderstandings.  But there's still one main twist in the end.  I really liked the actress Wendy Stuart who plays a character named ""Mistress Windy"" who has a crystal ball that changes colors.  There was also a funny drag queen named ""Goldie"" played by Clover Welsh.  But mostly this movie is all about the guys.",9.0
1326045,Day of the Clones,"⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

Mixed but Positive:
Day of the Clones is an ambitious sci-fi horror that succeeds in many areas but falters in others. At its core, the film tells a compelling story about the dangers of unchecked scientific ambition, but its uneven pacing and character development hold it back from reaching its full potential.

The premise—a group of survivors trapped in a farmhouse, hunted by clones created by one of their own—immediately draws viewers into the post-apocalyptic nightmare. Johnny Topping and Laura Montgomery Bennett carry much of the emotional weight as Andrew and Lindsey, a couple struggling not only with external threats but also the internal pressures of guilt and survival. Topping’s performance is solid, particularly as Andrew wrestles with the unintended consequences of his cloning experiments. The tension between protecting loved ones and facing the reality of his past gives the film its moral center.

One of the film’s strongest assets is its atmosphere. Director Eric Ian Steele makes the most of the stark Manchester winter, capturing desolate, pandemic-emptied streets that enhance the film’s apocalyptic mood. The film feels eerily real, thanks to the isolated, cold backdrop. This adds depth to the tension, especially as the group’s paranoia grows in their claustrophobic surroundings.

Where Day of the Clones stumbles is in its pacing. The film starts strong, establishing its characters and premise, but the middle act drags, losing some of the momentum that the earlier tension built up. A few scenes feel unnecessarily prolonged, and some character interactions lack the depth to sustain audience investment. However, the final third brings the action and suspense back to life, culminating in a thrilling climax that raises the stakes.

Ultimately, Day of the Clones stands as a bold and original entry in the sci-fi horror genre, offering plenty for fans of dystopian survival stories. It draws clear inspiration from genre classics like The Thing and Dawn of the Dead, blending their claustrophobic horror with fresh, thought-provoking themes about cloning, survival, and humanity's overreach. Though it may stumble in its execution, the film’s atmosphere and underlying ethical questions make it worth watching.",5.0
1324019,Tiddler,"What the eponymous young fish lacks in size it makes up for with an enormous imagination. Constantly late for school, his excuses to teacher ""Miss Skate"" become more creatively outlandish by the day. There's pirate treasure, a shark attack, a giant squid - even some fisherman's nets! Thing is, though, all his schoolfriends think he's just ""Pinnochio"" with fins. Astonishingly, one of these tall stories is actually true and leaves him a way from home, lost, and needing the most unconventional trail of literal breadcrumbs if he is to find his way back to his school and best friend ""Johnny Dory"". The style of animation reminded me quite a bit of the ""Gruffalo"" - indeed I'm sure I saw a scaly version of that very beastie at some point here. The story is a characterful one along the lines of boy who cried wolf, it's engagingly told and uses different styles to help us distinguish between his real life and his fantasies. It's a tale with a moral, sure, but that's delivered quite charmingly and it shows that you don't need Disney budgets to tell an enjoyable to watch story of underwater adventures that teaches us about all kinds of fish, too!",7.0

1260004,Pulau Hantu,"Pulau Hantu manages to offer something more than your typical Indonesian horror. Coming in with no expectations, I was immediately drawn in by the film’s mix of suspense and emotional storytelling.

The movie opens with a well-placed flashback that sets up the central mystery. The character introductions are clear, making it easy to follow the plot and the strong friendships among the protagonists. The flashbacks are used sparingly and effectively, helping build tension without dragging down the pace. The main antagonist, Mala, is a standout—her presence makes every scene more intense, and the jump scares connected to her are smartly timed.

Visually, the film excels. The cinematography and color grading make the most of the island setting, bringing the beach, forest, and darker scenes to life. The film’s atmosphere is rich, pulling you deeper into the story as it unfolds.

Mala’s backstory, revealed through flashbacks, adds surprising depth to her character. By the final act, she becomes someone you empathize with, which isn’t something you expect from a horror movie. The transition to the emotional climax is handled well, with the main protagonist, Dara, standing out as her story hits home in the final moments.

While there’s room for deeper character development earlier in the film, Pulau Hantu succeeds in delivering a story that is both suspenseful and emotionally resonant. It’s not just about the scares—there’s real heart in the writing, and the ending leaves a lasting impression.",8.0
1258626,Lật Mặt 7: Một Điều Ước,"The title of this film in no way prepared me for what I was about to see! A charming old grandmother ""Madame Hai"" (Thanh Hiền) is content tending her flowers at her rural home when she has a bit of a mishap that puts her leg in plaster. Even though she is surrounded by helpful neighbours, it's clear the she cannot look after herself, so children have to take it in turns whilst she recovers. Her daughter, with whom she lives, must contend with a very ill girl of her own, so it falls to the other four siblings to argue about who will make some sacrifices and compromise their own busy schedules to accommodate the old lady. First it's the wealthy brother whose job is on the line and whose daughter is a bit prone to fighting at school; the second is an hen-pecked fisherman with a kindly young daughter and a sagely old in-law. Then it's the turn of the daughter (my favourite scenario) who works with her husband on a flower farm and who tries to convince her mother that they live in a big house with a pool - but do they really? Finally, a young son with an expectant wife take their turn. The old lady is embarrassed to be a burden, but each story serves as a sort of mini-parable with a message about familial values, priorities and the wisdom of age. The episodes are quite good fun, but once they are over the story rather loses it's way as the grannie sells up and absconds leaving her children to worry and panic. That's hardly plausible, nor, really, is much of the last half hour or so as the story loses much of its impetus, humour and focus. It's got a sort of nondescript television style score too that doesn't really help it along either and that's a shame as the family dramas are quite funny and engaging. It is way too long but Thanh Hiền's gentle personification of an old lady whose not without her wits makes for a decent template for the first half of the drama. I don't watch much Vietnamese cinema, but maybe presenting stories depicting their own rich culture might work better if they leave out the attempts to appeal so overtly to a Western audience?",6.0

1229261,The Black Sea,"Being a stranger in a strange land can be an uncomfortable, exasperating experience. At the same time, though, it can also be just what one needs, especially for those seeking to turn their lives around. Such is the case with Khalid (actor-director Derrick B. Harden), a genial, ambitious, opportunistic African-American dreamer from Brooklyn who, sadly, just doesn’t seem to be able to get his act together. But, when he’s offered a lucrative new opportunity – one he finds on Facebook of all places – to relocate to Sozopol, a small Bulgarian resort town on the Black Sea coast, to become the “companion” of a woman in desperate “need” of finding a Black man (on the advice of a fortune teller), he jumps at the chance. There’s just one hitch – hours before his arrival, she dies, thereby stranding him without his payment and the means to return home. Those circumstances are further complicated when his passport is stolen, leaving him stuck and unable to book a flight back to the US. He thus reluctantly becomes reconciled to the idea of having to stay put for a while as he attempts to sort out his circumstances. However, the more time he spends in his unexpected new home, the more he finds himself easily fitting in and making friends with the locals, especially Ina (Irmena Chichikova), the owner of a travel agency and his eventual business partner in a popular café/night spot. And, except for some menacing dealings with a powerful local godfather (Stoyo Mirkov) who’s accustomed to being the community’s top dog (and resents being upstaged by the popular new arrival), things generally go well for the unwitting transplant. But will they stay that way? Directors Harden and Crystal Moselle have put together a real charmer in this warm, funny comedy-drama chronicling the evolution of an infectiously likable character beset with a seemingly impossible challenge but who aggressively hustles to successfully make lemonade out of the big bushel of lemons that’s been handed him. The story’s focus on a hapless but amiable everyman who’s unceremoniously marooned in a wholly unfamiliar setting (one that most American viewers are also likely unfamiliar with) in which he doesn’t speak the language gives this film a distinctive character all its own, a refreshing development in light of the current sagging state of the domestic movie industry. Despite some occasional narrative meandering, this offering is otherwise a real gem, a heartwarming comedy in which one can’t help but pull for the underdog, no matter how much he might slip up or inadvertently get in his own way. “The Black Sea” is indeed a rare find, one that now genuinely deserves to have an audience find it.",8.0
1211803,Radioactive: The Women of Three Mile Island,"Given the blatantly self-serving attempts at spin, unrepentant obfuscation and outright lying that we see so much of these days coming from officialdom, big business and the media, it’s no wonder that so many of us have become fed up with such brazenly untruthful tactics. And that’s not just activists and advocates saying this – it’s a growing sentiment from everyday citizens who’ve tired of the practice of unbridled deliberate deception. Such actions may have been harder to spot years ago, but, when life-threatening circumstances are on the line, it’s inspiring to see how quickly and fervently riled-up individuals can get. That was the case with what happened in the wake of the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident, when it became obvious that falsely reassuring messages about the allegedly trivial nature of the incident began to become apparent to the Pennsylvania locals who resided in the danger zone and suffered the consequences that came from it. A groundswell of protests spearheaded by four courageous women and their ardent attorneys emerged, even if those efforts did not receive much attention at the time. However, this debut documentary feature from writer-director Heidi Hutner, a professor of sustainability studies at Stony Brook University, seeks to change all that by bringing the stories of these determined advocates to light – as well as making known just how serious this downplayed incident really was. Through a series of interviews with the movement’s principals, as well as a wealth of archive footage from the time, audiences witness what these individuals went through personally and as leaders of a campaign where they met pervasive resistance, condescending gender discrimination and ongoing intimidation from corporate and government sources. This offering also features first-time interviews with an insider/whistleblower who worked at the plant and with actress/social activist Jane Fonda, whose film “The China Syndrome” (1979), a fictional depiction of a nuclear power plant disaster, ironically premiered only two weeks before this real world event unfolded. Hutner’s release, which has now become available for streaming, on home media and at special screenings, presents a powerful, damning indictment of how ineptly this incident was handled and a heroic profile of the outspoken champions who were willing to go all-out, despite the obstacles, to make their case known. Even if they didn’t garner the attention they deserved at the time, this film helps to make up for that, shining a bright light on the reckless carelessness of those willing to place their own interests ahead of the welfare of innocent victims – and how those victims fought back to make their voices heard.",9.0

1108790,Una jauría llamada Ernesto,"Following a few characters called ""Ernesto"", this documentary follows what can really only be described as the grooming of young people from eight years old through to an adulthood where crime is the only option. Petty crime at first, drug-running for older people, but the first gun takes ambitions to another level and the commentary delivers a statement along the lines that killing a man is fine because we all get killed one day! This isn't a chaotic existence. The gangs have an hierarchy, a loyalty and an inter-dependency that proves to be solid and supportive if you live within it's rules. It's a sub-culture based on survival, the dream of prosperity and an escape from the drudgery of their largely poverty-stricken existances surrounded by a broader society which they feel offers them little but regulation and inhibition. The narrative illustrates well the prodigious nature of gun-crime in Mexico where life is cheap, but to be honest - I hated the photography. Clearly, anonymity was important but the constant use of phone-cameras with obscured faces or mounted on what looked like a rucksack just made me feel a bit dizzy after a while. There is only so much of the back of an head I wanted to see before I felt that I was riding backie on an undulating bike. The camera always tracking fractionally, and often quite jerkily, behind the body movements. Though that style does add and sustain a sense of intensity to the story, it became quite uncomfortable to watch and I found myself just too distracted. It's certainly a story worth telling, and watching - but as a cinema experience, it's not the most comfortable to watch - on any level.",6.0
955424,Merchant Ivory,"In the annals of filmmaking, few cinematic collaborations can match the accomplishments of Merchant Ivory Productions, the brainchild of producer Ismail Merchant and director James Ivory, whose work together yielded a prolific 43 movies. While perhaps best known for such iconic period piece offerings as “A Room with a View” (1985), “Maurice” (1987), “Howards End” (1992) and “Remains of the Day” (1993), the duo was also responsible for many other releases primarily filmed in the US, the UK and India, often with the participation of a “family” of regular contributors, including screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and composer Richard Robbins. Their work is now showcased in this insightful documentary from director Stephen Soucy, featuring contemporary and archive interview footage with this team of creatives, along with numerous film clips and the observations of various crew members and a stellar lineup of actors featured in their films, including Emma Thompson, Anthony Hopkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Hugh Grant, Helena Bonham Carter, James Wilby, Rupert Graves, Samuel West and James Fox. However, this offering goes beyond presenting a mere litany of accomplishments, providing an in-depth examination of the sensibilities that characterized this team’s output and the back stories of how these productions came into being (often on shoestring budgets and under rigorous, sometimes-contentious filming conditions). The film also looks at the personal lives of its two principals, who were romantically linked as one of the movie industry’s first gay power couples at a time when such relationships weren’t looked on with the same degree of tolerance that’s in place today. What’s more, much of this material is punctuated with a healthy sprinkling of wry wit, providing viewers with many laugh-out-loud moments, a quality not often seen in documentary releases. Fans of these tremendous talents are sure to enjoy everything that’s on offer here, while those unfamiliar with their work can savor an excellent introduction to one of the movie industry’s formidable creative teams, as well as an array of film classics well worth seeing. In an age where cinema has been experiencing its share of letdowns, it’s heartening to see a showcase for the repertoire of what truly great filmmakers are capable of, giving avid moviegoers hope that this is not a declining artform but one that can be revived, one would hope to match the accomplishments of those who contributed significantly to establishing its richly deserved legacy.",7.0
651439,Saturn,"Moral dilemmas often call for making hard choices, matters necessitating profound, introspective soul-searching. And, as this insightful sci-fi offering illustrates, it’s a process that not only includes us mortals, but also extends to supernatural beings possessing tremendous powers and even greater responsibilities. When the Earth’s existence is threatened by the sudden appearance of an enormous, mysterious, seemingly menacing planet in the sky above, a mild-mannered professor and family man (Dominic Bogart) who carries a secret about his true nature must decide whether to continue living out the life he so dearly enjoys or live up to an ancient obligation as a protector of the world. Can he make the right choice between quiet domestic contentment with his wife (Piercey Dalton) and son (Elijah Maximus), or must he inevitably bring himself to sacrifice this tranquil life in order to fulfill his sacred responsibility of keeping his promise to save a questionably deserving planet, one that has repeatedly failed through the ages to attain the stability and social maturity hoped for it by its guardian shepherds? Such is the heady question presented in writer-director Eric Esau’s morality play set in a world of extraordinary circumstances. The filmmaker’s third feature outing provides viewers with a look into a scenario where much is on the line for both the planet and for one of the individuals sworn to save it, along with the personal reflection he must undergo in deciding which choice to make. While the film could occasionally use some quickened pacing in the first half, it nevertheless delivers on its central premise with ample heartfelt emotion, a quality rarely seen in sci-fi offerings to the degree that it’s on display here, a trait that truly sets this release apart from other such pictures that rely more heavily on special effects and other glitzy gimmicks to carry the story. It might even bring a tear to one’s eye, something almost unheard of for releases in this genre. Admittedly, though, finding this offering may take some effort at the moment, as it has been principally playing the film festival circuit, but it’s a movie decidedly deserving of wider attention as a theatrical or streaming release. If you’re an ardent fan of movies like this, “Saturn” should definitely be on your watchlist.",7.0
393897,EFC,"**A Powerful Journey That Inspires the Soul!**

EFC is nothing short of an emotional rollercoaster that left me deeply inspired. From the moment the story unfolds, you can tell it's going to be a unique cinematic experience. The characters are relatable, and their journeys are filled with heartfelt moments of struggle, growth, and triumph.

The direction by Jaze Bordeaux is exceptional, blending stunning visuals with a narrative that feels raw and authentic. Every scene seems to carry a message—about perseverance, about believing in yourself even when the odds are stacked against you. The cast delivers powerful performances, especially the lead (Karlee Rose), who manages to convey vulnerability and strength in equal measure.

What I loved most about EFC is its ability to resonate with audiences on a personal level. It’s not just a movie; it’s a reminder that no matter how tough life gets, it's important to keep dreaming and never give up on hope! It's a reminder that determination can carry us through. The film's message of never giving up is one that everyone can take to heart.

By the end, I was left with a renewed sense of purpose and motivation. EFC is a must-watch for anyone who needs a bit of inspiration in their lives. It’s a beautiful, uplifting story that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",10.0
393897,EFC,"**EFC is  a real women's MMA movie!**

I recently watched ""EFC,"" a movie about women in mixed martial arts. This movie was really about women in the world of mixed martial arts and actually had real MMA fight scenes and a lot of them but the movie was more than just the fight scenes.

The film stars Karlee Rose as Cassady Jones, a champion MMA fighter who starts off defending her title against a rising star named Alexa Star, played by Kathryn Aboya.

While the film has its flaws, I still found it entertaining and worth watching because the movie was a bout more than women fighting in the octagon. The fight went into the boardroom for the future of the sport. The fight scenes were incredible and exciting to watch, 100% the fight scenes were the star of the movie.

The acting was solid, particularly from Karlee Rose and Avaah Blackwell, who both did a good job portraying their characters' determination and vulnerability and straight out craziness. 

However, the story was a bit predictable and didn't explore the characters' backgrounds and motivations as much as I would've liked but if you're a fan of sports dramas or enjoy watching strong female leads, ""EFC"" is definitely worth checking out.",8.0

Starring budding actors, **BubbyTumkens**, **Smoah** and **Marcus' Dad**. In particular, **Marcus' Dad** utilizes a haunting voice to describe the turmoil that the small town of _Cringlesberg_ is witnessing, this is a masterful use of exposition by Director/Editor/Camera guy **DestinyDonut**. And then after that the movie starts and i think i fell asleep to be honest. Although the stylistic choice of having every second shot be out of focus does remind me of famous Film Professor, **Inongav Nadroj**, and his teachings of camera work and the manipulation of the triangle of light, or some shit idk. Regardless, this film is clearly influenced by **Nadroj's** style as well as **Tarkovsky's**.

1398167,Please Think of the Narwhals,"At the beginning I thought this was just going to be one of those Greta Thunberg style pontifications saying green is good and everyone else is evil, but by layering this story from ridiculous to more ridiculous, it actually suggests a fair degree of commons sense at the end. It’s the young “Harry” (Louis Morris) who has been adopted by mums “Edith” (Aaliyah Warner) and “Marble” (Frankie Williams) and who is sick fed up of their refusal to recycle. Mum No. 1. is way to busy running her ball point pen and Exocet missiles businesses whilst No. 2 is just a yoga teaching natural litter lout. He tries to engage his friends, but it’s only when he warns of the existential danger to narwhals that he recruits “Gwen” (Summer Mainwaring) and they embark of a plan to cure his folks of their recalcitrant behaviour. What chance, though, when their early results merely ensure that picking up rubbish is criminalised? What ever would have happened to the Wombles? By exaggerating the scenario and by using a really quite engaging young lad to deliver the message, director Richard Price manages to poke fun at excess and zeal, irresponsibility and indifference with his tongue in his cheek and he also manages to quite amiably illustrate just how fickle politicians are to pressure groups and policies of whim.

Like just about everyone in their township, she runs some sort of foundation for the underprivileged, so when there is a newcomer to their compound of rather grand looking houses, and he has a legitimate NGO with which she can associate, she determines to befriend him. Thing is, ""Lobster"" (Stan Nze) has a big secret to keep that when his wife ""Olivia"" (Nancy Isime) finds out, leads to a confrontation witnessed by our eponymous nosey neighbour and resulting in a sort of Nigerian equivalent of a comedy-fatwa being put on her head. Meantime, she is lured to a beachside resort in Ghana where she is ostensibly to work on a wedding, but that proves to be fairly complicated too as her wooing boyfriend ""Shege"" (Falz) manages to get everyone embroiled in some shenanigans with the drug dealing ""Bebe"" (Jackie Appiah). All of this mess is presented in the style of a very cheaply produced soap opera, it's episodes sloppily stitched together with an annoyingly haphazard amount of dialogue that ends up just adding to the messiness of the whole thing. There's no doubt that Akindele has a sort of charm to her, but she's trying to cover way too many bases here and the scenarios are way more contrived than they are funny. It's perhaps rescued, on occasion, by the legal eagle that is ""Madame Bassey"" (Bosola Aiyeola) who reminded me a lot of ""Hetty"" from ""NCIS: Los Angeles"" - only more menacing, but otherwise I think I'd have to take issue with the title. I didn't love Jenifa, sorry.",5.0

It’s truly impressive that this film was made with the limited tools available to high school students in Surabaya, a city in Indonesia. The film is both heart-wrenching and inspiring, telling the story of Madurese migrants—an experience deeply connected to the people of Surabaya. The cinematography and narrative flow are remarkably pleasing to the eye, and while the issue presented may seem small, it is often those overlooked stories that carry the most weight. The work of the director and sound engineer is outstanding. Honestly, I deeply admire such a well-made short film.

He has no idea whether the man on the other side of the door will be kind and gentle; a BDSM gent looking for a “pussy eunuch”, a druggie, a priest, a strangler or worse than anything… An admirer of Margaret Thatcher! All those promises made online before they meet, but will his horniness get him to press that doorbell and what chance fulfilment if he does? With us getting to share all of these scenarios as they play out in his mind, this is quite a fun critique on our sexual peccadilloes and both the expressive faces of auteur Lyndon Henley Hanrahan - who must, surely, be offering us something vaguely autographical here, and his sexual foil Vincent Moisy make us cringe, smile and perhaps share in that feeling of can’t wait to get in, can’t wait to get out… Euphemisms notwithstanding!",7.0

1319971,Aloha Also Means Goodbye,"Aloha Also Means Goodbye is a story of the past colliding with the present.  When lovers from long ago meet unexpectedly decisions need to be made - kind of a ""do I"" or ""don't I"" scenario.  Filmed on the island of Maui, a stunning visual character in itself,  the story unfolds and emotional depths are revealed.  Can their love truly fade or will the right time reveal itself to rekindle?",
1319971,Aloha Also Means Goodbye,"What if you got a second chance with the one who got away... in paradise? Bryden Lando’s Aloha Also Means Goodbye explores this intriguing question through a beautifully crafted romantic drama set against the stunning backdrop of Hawaii.

The story centers on an over-worked, stressed-out mother whose marriage is on the brink of collapse. A business trip takes her to the serene shores of Hawaii, where she unexpectedly reunites with her free-spirited ex-lover. This chance encounter sparks a whirlwind adventure and a journey of self-discovery, blending romance with personal growth.

Lando’s direction is adept at juxtaposing the protagonist's hectic, high-pressure life with the relaxed, almost magical environment of Hawaii. The film skillfully uses the natural beauty and cultural richness of the islands to create a vivid contrast that enhances the protagonist's emotional journey. The lush landscapes, vibrant colors, and serene beaches provide a perfect setting for the unfolding drama.

The chemistry between the lead actors is undeniable and forms the heart of the film. Their performances bring depth to their characters, making their rekindled romance believable and emotionally engaging. The protagonist's transformation, prompted by the rediscovery of an old love, is depicted with nuance and sensitivity, allowing viewers to connect with her struggles and triumphs.

While the film touches on familiar romantic themes, it does so with a fresh perspective. The narrative delves into the complexities of love and second chances, exploring how past relationships can shape and influence present choices. The protagonist's internal conflict and the dynamic with her ex-lover are portrayed with realism, avoiding clichés and delivering genuine, heartfelt moments.

Supporting characters add richness to the story, each contributing to the protagonist’s journey in meaningful ways. The interactions with her ex-lover reveal layers of her personality and desires that have long been suppressed by her demanding life. These encounters are both light-hearted and deeply reflective, providing a balanced and engaging storyline.

Visually, Aloha Also Means Goodbye is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography captures the essence of Hawaii, making it not just a setting but a character in itself. The film’s pacing allows for moments of introspection amidst the scenic beauty, drawing viewers into the protagonist’s transformative experience.

In conclusion, Aloha Also Means Goodbye is a charming and evocative film that successfully blends romance and self-discovery. Bryden Lando has crafted a story that resonates with anyone who has pondered the possibilities of second chances. The film’s strengths lie in its strong performances, captivating setting, and the emotional depth of its characters. It’s a heartwarming tale that invites viewers to reflect on their own lives and the paths not taken, all while basking in the enchanting allure of paradise. This film is a must-watch for those who appreciate thoughtful, visually stunning romantic dramas.",7.0
1319971,Aloha Also Means Goodbye,"The story of a struggling couple coping with their relationship and a new baby, when an old flame inadvertently re-enters the picture.   Re-united through a business trip to Maui, young Alice takes a soulful journey of ""what-could-have-been and what-could-still-be.""

This film features a great premise and is beautifully shot and thought-provoking, featuring some very nice acting, although at times a little wandering script.   Acting performances are solid with Stephanie Lynn featured as Alice Monrow and Evan Gamble, as her re-united Maui love interest Taylor Hargrove.  

Director Bryden Lando is skillful with both cast and using the island location as a character of its own.  Scenes are often beautifully shot, although at times the sounds of the breathtaking scenery seems to take over the audio track, which certainly speaks to the indie nature of this film.

While not perfect, this is a nice little indie and my take is:  RECCOMEND.

1297423,Sabaton – The Tour to End All Tours,"I am not a Sabaton fan, so I saw this movie without knowing their music.  They are a heavy metal band that focuses much of their music on war themes (primarily WWI) with a patriotic/nationalistic flair. Much of it is based on the ordeal of soldiers as heroes. The band was jovial while performing seriously hard rock music. It was very easy to enjoy the music being played.

The movie is a full concert filmed in Amsterdam.  It was very well filmed and edited to enhance the show's drama capturing the energy of the band members as well as the exuberance of the audience. The camera never rests on one view for more than 5 seconds giving the viewer a lot of visual stimulation while capturing the best aspects of the performance. 

As someone who was exposed to their music for the first time viewing this film, I can say it was very enjoyable to watch. I would assume any existing fan would find it to be amazing.",7.0

An impressive debut feature from a promising young director. Lucy Rankin has clearly found inspiration from the greats of cinema, notably Martin Scorsese and has used this to her full advantage giving what feels like a love letter to the golden era of cinema while also providing a challenging, philosophical movie that is engaging from the opening shot to the last.

While the inspirations are on full display, this is in no way a carbon copy. Lucy has managed to create her own visual flair and style with great uses of sound design and a brilliant piano theme that adds to the overall dread and the weight of the choices our two protagonists are faced with. It is clear that she had a strong vision from the moment she finalised the script to the last edit, this is the work of someone who is truly passionate for cinema and wants to give audiences something to remember.",10.0

1275025,Out,"An old saying about those who were once sheltered from the ways of the world but miraculously blossom when exposed to the panorama of life astutely maintains, “How are you going to keep ʼem down on the farm once they’ve seen Paris?” It’s a sentiment that’s equally applicable to many other cosmopolitan, urbane locales, such as the free-wheeling, uninhibited pace of life in Amsterdam, as a gay male couple from a small Dutch town discover when they relocate to the big city to attend film school. In many ways, it’s a dream come true, providing them with an opportunity to cast off the shackles of a restrictive, closeted lifestyle in favor of something eminently more liberating. But is it really the panacea they’ve long hoped for? For Tom (Bas Keizer), it’s more than he bargained for as he struggles to cast off his conservative smalltown ways (including continuing to insist that he’s bisexual and not the out and proud gay man he’s been reluctant to openly acknowledge), while, for his partner, Ajani (Jefferson Yaw Frempong-Manson), it’s a chance to finally cut loose and truly be himself. Tom is also disappointed with his film school experience, finding it difficult to fit in as a would-be arthouse auteur among peers who are far less constrained (and less condescending) in their creativity and artistic sensibilities. Ajani, meanwhile, grows increasingly concerned that his partner is having trouble at school and not availing himself of the city’s unrestrained LGBTQ+ experience, staying stuck in his uptight ways. Over time, these conditions give rise to a disconnect between them, one that threatens the future of their relationship and the end of a dream they had long awaited to fulfill. Writer-director Dennis Alink’s latest provides viewers with an insightful look into the urban gay lifestyle in both its positive and negative attributes, not to mention how two seemingly likable characters can both be major jerks when they want to be, both with their emerging circle of friends and with each other. Shot in stunningly gorgeous black and white in quasi-documentary style, the film serves up an array of both gorgeous and “ugly” imagery, giving audiences an unfettered look at a community that clearly has two sides to it. Admittedly, the narrative at times meanders a bit too much for its own good, but it generally does a commendable job at showing rather than telling in conveying its message, making its points and presenting its story. “Out” is a film that earnestly makes clear “gay” doesn’t always equate to “happy,” but it also lets us know that the satisfaction level of our experience depends heavily on what we ultimately do – or don’t do – with it.",7.0
1263495,Make Love Not Porn,"Watching the familiar streets of Thessaloniki in Greece that I frequently strolled between 1977 and 1990 brings happy memories of the time when Greece was an economic super power of the Balkans… and I am so glad that the EU didn’t manage to kill the eternal flame of art lovers in this country (and the ancient city) as they killed the economy and freedom. Love for real art unites; art (or anything else) for love of money divides and on a long run destroys!

1249226,The Stimming Pool,"The first ten minutes of this documentary don’t really comes across as anything too different. We meet two gents who run a sci-fi film club at their local cinema in Hastings talking about the the relative merits - well demerits, really, of schlock. We get some clues from their language that one of the two is neurodiverse. Their introduction showcases a few further vignettes from others whose appreciation of things artistic (and scientific) might vary from those of the bulk of the population, and the six directors offer us a compendium of projects that challenge the standard way of film creation and production. As we get deeper into this experimental feature, we discover that they are all working together as they create their “Stimming Pool” concept, or really a series of concepts, that don’t really have much to do with each other. It works, up to a point, and the characters are genuinely interesting to follow but the lack of cohesion makes it struggle as a joined-up piece of cinema. Each feature in itself makes for a watchable enough short film, but when we put them altogether it becomes quite disjointed. That’s not to say that it misses it’s mark - it does open eyes to different perceptions of what might be considered “standard”, but the assembly style of storytelling darts about too often without contextualising enough for those watching to learn or understand rather than associate with. Still, it’s worth a watch and is at times quite thought-provoking.",6.0
1221263,"Rock, Paper, Scissors","A young man is playing this game with a younger boy in what looks like a makeshift hospital where a solitary doctor is trying to tend to the wounds of many casualties. It transpires that they are awaiting a truck to take them to somewhere possibly safer, but when “Ivan” (Oleksandr Rudynskyy) goes outside to reconnoitre he sees a Russian war plane blow it to smithereens. Their radio contact informs him that there are enemy soldiers close by and so taking a rifle from one of the other casualties he sets off to protect them all. He finds, though, that seeing a man through his gunsight and actually pulling the trigger are two completely different matters, and in the end - with so much of the battle being fought remotely from the skies, would killing them make any real difference to their plight? The effort from Rudynskyy, his character barely a man himself, is touching and the sentiment of the piece palpably tugs at your heart-strings as does the bleakness, almost moon-scale nature, of their medical hole in the ground. It’s set in Ukraine but serves as a much more depressing indictment of warfare in general.",7.0
1214559,Sue Bird: In the Clutch,"Director Sarah Dowland’s documentary “Sue Bird: In the Clutch” plays like a career highlight reel of its subject, one of the true GOATs of women’s professional basketball. The film delves into Bird’s life history features candid interviews with her family, friends, former coaches, colleagues, peers, and teammates, which makes it tons of fun for WNBA fans. Even better, the documentary gives a thorough overview to those unfamiliar with the subject or the sport.

Bird, a point guard who became a Seattle Storm franchise player and legend, played professional basketball for over two decades. The film spans her incredible 21 year career, from her origins as a baller in high school up to her winning five Olympic gold medals. Now that she’s reaching retirement, Bird and her fiancée, U.S. soccer star Megan Rapinoe, are learning to navigate a new life ahead.

As with most biopic documentaries, the film is a positive-leaning celebration of its subject’s storied career. What makes this one different is that Dowland asks the questions you really want to hear, and Bird answers them with honesty.

The insider stories are so interesting, including perspectives from her best friend (and equally impressive WNBA legend) Diana Taurasi, including how difficult it is to overcome racism and sexism in the male-dominated sports world, what it’s like to represent your country on the world stage, and the dangers playing overseas in the off-season. I felt like I learned so much about Bird, and I’ve grown to respect her achievements even more after watching this documentary.

“Sue Bird: In the Clutch” celebrates the trailblazer who has and will continue to inspire so many young girls to take up the sport of basketball. It’s a great documentary that will delight WNBA fans and also introduce so many to one of the greatest players to ever embrace the game.

1211740,Nocturnes,"There's a line in this documentary that tells us that moth-watching is a waiting game, and that it requires patience. Well, so is a film about them - and for much of this we don't really advance much in our search of the reclusive hawk moth in the forests of the Himalayas. When it does come alive, though, it's fascinating to see the sheer variety of flying nightlife their screen attracts as they try, quite meticulously, to position it to attract these creatures that are drawn to the light. The people here actually add very little, indeed I could probably have done without them altogether. Just leave us with the imagery and some pretty impressive audio and you can quite literally get lost amidst the wonders of a natural world that we rarely stop and take notice of. At times it sounds as if you are in the middle of a monsoon with the wings of thousands of insects flapping furiously for the few days or weeks they have to live before they breed-on, die or are food for an equally astonishing array of suitably adapted fauna. It's a bit on the long side and can be repetitive, but the vibrancy of the sounds and colours hit the mark from time to time and it's quite a therapeutic watch.",6.0
1208013,Rent Free,"Most of us have no doubt heard the old saying (adapted from the famous poem by Robert Burns), “The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.” And, in the case of a pair of hopelessly lost Gen Z misfits (Jacon Roberts, David Treviño), truer words couldn’t have been spoken. The two longtime friends from Austin, TX attempt to relocate to New York, but, when their plans fall through, they return home to regroup and figure out a way to get back to the Big Apple. They “decide” to land good-paying jobs (without any realistic prospects) from which they can diligently (or so they believe) stash away bundles of cash for a year and, simultaneously, multiply their savings by finding ways to live rent free with (i.e., shamelessly sponge off of) friends, family and even strangers, a plan they’re thoroughly convinced will work. However, the reality turns out to be far different from their hopelessly misguided wishful thinking, straining their friendships with others and themselves. Their wickedly funny story (with a few touching moments) turns out to be a damning exploration of improbable, unworkable thinking, unbridled irresponsibility, inflated entitlement and generally bad form between themselves and with those who offer to help them out (but who subsequently prove to have agendas of their own as well). One would like to hope that this experience will work out (or at least provide them with a much-needed wake-up call), but will it? In that sense, “Rent Free” is a brutally telling story about a generation that not only hasn’t come of age, but that is in serious need of growing up. Writer-director Fernando Andrés’ second feature offering delivers a bitingly blistering modern day road trip/buddy movie of sorts about two lost souls seeking to find themselves but who perpetually get in their own way. It’s particularly noteworthy for the fact that this is a film involving individuals who are part of the LGBTQ+ community but whose sexuality is more ancillary than integral to the narrative, allowing their other personal attributes and actions to carry the picture and not relying exclusively on scenarios related to their gay and bisexual orientation to define them or the nature of the story. Some viewers (particularly younger ones) may be insulted or offended by some of the content here, but perhaps that’s because the filmmaker holds up a highly polished, undeniably scrutinous mirror to them and their lifestyles, providing a profoundly revelatory look at why their lives don’t live up to their assumed expectations. Indeed, there is no such thing as a free lunch, and this inspired, razor-sharp offering proves that – whether viewers want to see that or not.",8.0
1115584,Mountains,"When an established community (and its associated culture) begins to disappear, its constituents (particularly those who come from an immigrant background) start to experience a palpable sense of passing into oblivion. At the same time, though, some of the residents of those neighborhoods are faced with the dilemma of having to ask themselves, “Am I part of the loss or part of its cause? And, in either case, how do I deal with the outcome and my role in it?” Such is the case for Xavier (Atibon Nazaire), a structural demolition worker who resides in Miami’s Little Haiti neighborhood with his wife, Esperance (Sheila Anozier), and his adult son, Xavier Jr. (Chris Renois). The community is rapidly and aggressively becoming gentrified with each building that’s being bought up and hastily torn down to make room for new development. Xavier relishes the good money he’s making from a job whose impact he either can’t or won’t acknowledge, even when he sees the consequences of what comes from it all around him, his immediate and extended family, and the friends, neighbors and fellow countrymen of this long-settled immigrant community. It ultimately gives him pause to reflect on his past and to give thought to his future and that of subsequent generations of his people. Writer-director Monica Sorelle’s debut feature quietly yet powerfully tells a story typical of many urban neighborhoods and the effects such transformations have on the local culture, shown here through a vibrant panorama of sights, sounds, music and colors, as well as the emotions of those who live in these areas. Their expressions of hope, joy, disappointment and regret are poignantly displayed through simple gestures, revealing facial expressions and telling body language, speaking volumes often without saying a word. While the picture can at times feel a little too “slice of life” for its own good (and leaving viewers wondering where the story may be headed), it ultimately conveys its messages through its fine performances, gorgeous cinematography and skillful film editing. As the nominee of two 2023 Independent Spirit Awards (including a win for the director in the competition’s “Someone To Watch” Award category), as well as numerous film festival award victories and nominations, “Mountains” is an impressive start for a filmmaker who clearly has much to say and a knack for knowing how to effectively say it, especially when it comes to speaking for those who may not have a readily accessible voice of their own.",7.0
1115584,Mountains,"Mountains: A Mille-feuille of Layered Subtexts

In Monica Sorelle's ""Mountains"", a seemingly simple film about gentrification is much more than urban transformation. In one of several subtexts of this rich film, it's a profound exploration of how unmet expectations erode the human spirit.

Set in Miami's Little Haiti, the film follows Xavier, a demolition worker whose daily labor of tearing down houses for his own neighborhood's gentrification becomes a metaphor for the systematic dismantling of personal and collective dreams.

Psychological research by Davidai and Gilovich, and Buddhist philosophy also, hold that unmet expectations cause suffering. Sorelle's subtext demonstrates how attachment to expectations creates internal ""demolition"" more devastating than any physical reconstruction. Xavier's hopes - for work stability, for upward mobility, for the mythical promise of American ""equality"", for his son's future - become sources of profound psychological tension.

The film's genius lies in its subtlety. Physical demolition mirrors psychological erosion. Each demolished building represents not just urban change, but the gradual collapse of Xavier's constructed narratives about success and belonging.

""Mountains"" is less about gentrification and more about the universal human experience of confronting the gap between our expectations and reality. In Xavier's quiet suffering, we recognize our own. It's one of those rich films that speaks to us on many layers.",8.0
1081260,Psychonaut,"Imagine a film that’s capable of moving the needle forward in multiple genres simultaneously. If you can picture that, then you owe it to yourself to see this imaginative, impressive third feature from writer-director Thijs Meuwese, an offering that effectively advances smart horror and LGBTQ+ cinema at the same time. In this dark futuristic tale, when an accidental shooting leaves Dylan (Yasmin Blake) fighting for her life from a severe head wound, her girlfriend, Maxime (Julia Batelaan), desperately looks for a way to save her. But, rather than take Dylan to a hospital, Maxime drives her to the home of her estranged mother, Samantha (Fiona Dourif), an alternative physician who employs a special diagnostic and treatment device for healing the sick and injured. However, when Dylan is hooked up to the equipment, Maxime and Samantha discover that the outlook is bleak unless they can help Dylan isolate an essential root memory that can be tapped by the device to rewrite the wiring of the injured portions of her brain, a tactic that’s hoped will restore her to full health. Despite the promise of this treatment, though, the question remains, what constitutes that essential memory and how can it be found? That’s the task Maxime undertakes when she electronically links her psyche with Dylan’s in an effort to locate the memory that will enable her recovery. What follows is a surreal psychological odyssey in which Maxime and Dylan explore their minds together to find what they’re looking for. The result is a seamless fusion of past experiences and present forensic investigation, a journey that reveals more than either of them expected, including revelations about themselves and their relationship, Maxime’s longstanding troubled connection with her mother, and how their current circumstances have turned out as they have, much of which has little to do with the catalytic shooting that launched this internal adventure. The filmmaker thus leads viewers on a captivating saga that successfully blends a variety of engaging elements, masterfully edited without missing a beat, including through the unexpected plot twists that pop up along the way. This dazzling journey is further enhanced by its gorgeous cinematography (shot largely in a captivating mix of black, white and red) and an inventively detailed production design, including its quasi-Gothic sets and thoughtfully chosen background elements. And, thankfully, unlike many other contemporary psychological thrillers, the film doesn’t overstay its welcome, skillfully telling its tale with an economic 1:27:00 runtime and no unnecessary filler or padding. What’s most notable, though, is the filmmaker’s ability to present a horror film that goes beyond trite tried-and-true tropes, as well as an LGBTQ+ storyline that pushes the envelope of most typical narratives in this genre, and that it effectively does both in one film. That’s quite an accomplishment, one worthy of high praise. Admittedly, there are a few times when this release verges on being a little too clever for its own good, but those instances are hardly worth mentioning in the wake of everything else it has to offer. “Psychonaut” is a sleeper that truly deserves an audience, especially for fans of films in either of these categories, a release that delivers brilliantly on both fronts.",9.0
1065311,Starring Jerry as Himself,"I’m all one for experimental cinema, but, in the end, the experiment has to work. Unfortunately, however, that’s where this debut feature from writer-director Law Chen (primarily the creator of film shorts and music videos) sorely misses the mark. Based on a true story whose very soundness is somewhat called into question (as demonstrably observed in the picture’s opening credits), this “fictionalized documentary” about retiree Jerry Liu (portrayed here by his real-life counterpart, amateur actor-writer Jerry Hsu) tells the story of how this hard-working but naïve Chinese immigrant living in Orlando was scammed out of his life savings by conmen posing as police officers from Shanghai investigating a supposed international money laundering scheme. The twist here, though, is how this regrettable incident unexpectedly led Jerry to fulfill his long-held dream of becoming a screenwriter/filmmaker, an aspiration he tinkered with as an amateur in his younger days with his wife and three sons (who appear as themselves in this production). Hsu contends that he wanted to make this movie as a cautionary tale to warn other seniors how to protect themselves against scams like the one he fell for, primarily as a result of holding on too firmly to a belief in being overly trusting of others. It’s also something of an homage to the concept of it never being too late in life to start over, particularly when it comes to living out and fulfilling a personal dream. Yet, while both of those intentions are certainly laudable, their execution here leaves much to be desired with its awkward mix of documentarian-style filmmaking and odd attempts at fictionalization (at times verging on the surreal and even hinting at the emerging cognizance issues that Jerry was experiencing at the time of this incident). The result is a picture that doesn’t feel fully fleshed out (or thought out), a weird cross between home movies and an experimental arthouse project that ultimately comes across more like a film school assignment. It’s also difficult to determine how seriously the film takes itself, with an undercurrent of humor that doesn’t always feel appropriate given the troubling circumstances involved in this story. In the end, it’s not entirely clear what “Starring Jerry as Himself” was attempting to achieve, but the finished product definitely doesn’t feel like it attained its goal.",5.0

A high school retelling of a horror classic that has effort but is also truly inept, the actors you can tell are trying their best and so are the filmmakers who you can tell love the source material they do their best to create sets and creatures.

1449517,A Lenda do Homem Pássaro,"I was looking for some amateur short film to watch on the internet, and I was not let down by ""The Legend of the Bird Man"".
The writing is incredibly smart, and it gets even crazier when you find out the writer is only 15 years old + he also directed AND acted the main character in the film.
And talking about the main character (which is simply called ""Bird Man"", as he is not identified in any moment throughout the film), his arc is very complex and engaging. All scenes seem to bring something new to the table and, during it's 16 minutes, ""A Lenda do Homem Pássaro"" managed to keep me on the edge of my seat for the most time
Janosh's acting skills are very memorable, as he is able to keep as interest in the film with very ""boring dialogue scenes"". His interpretation is honestly kind of frightning, as he slowly gives us sublte hints of his character's ultimate demise.
The direction is also on point, as almost no frames are wasted and every single scene puts more and more tension, and I can surely say the last sequence is easily one of the most intense + smart I've seen on the world of amateur filmmaking.
Unfortunately, the film does lack some quality when talking about video and audio quality, and the access is very restricted (I had a hard time finding the film + the english subtitles), but it was all worth it.
It's not for everybody, but I'd encourage anyone who wants to support independent filmmaking to support this film and it's autors, ""Os Napolitanos"".

I'm referencing, of course, our phones and other ""smart"" devices which we're now using obsessively for most of our waking (and even non-waking) hours. Unlike in most sci-fi, they're not embodied in humanoid robot form and they're not trying to kill us. They're everywhere and in everything and they're always trying to help us. This means that we can't just shut them off or smash them up, and even if we could we wouldn't want to. Or, at least, it would be unwise to destroy them, because we'd be destroying our connection to distant family, friends, news, finances, entertainment, education, employment, etc. We'd be essentially destroying our connection to the rest of humanity. This was especially true during the Covid-19 lockdowns, but that phase in our society accelerated a cultural tendency toward an increasingly codependent relationship with our phones. It's a relationship that can't very easily be opted out of. It must be revolted against, but because it's so deeply embedded in our culture, revolting against the technology can often mean revolting against humanity and revolting against our natural human tendencies. And most of us are not revolutionaries anyway. It's much easier to just leave things as they are and let the phones (and the corporations & governments that control the phones) dictate the flow of our lives...

These thoughts inspired me to make MAN VS PHONE. But could a movie about someone's evolving relationship with their phone actually be watchable? Yes, it could. HER proved that it could. However, HER also involves other people and multiple locations. I didn't have the budget for all that. So, I saw the movies LOCKE and BURIED. They proved that an entertaining feature could be made with just one person in one location talking on the phone. And of course decades earlier, an almost feature length section of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY proved that you can tell an entertaining story with just one person in one location talking to an AI person who is embodied only by a camera lens. This all proved to me that I could make the movie I wanted to make without having the budget for locations or a cast or crew...

So, except for one section of VO, I am the entire cast & crew. It might sound crazy, because it is crazy. But I did it. And it won Best Writer, Feature Film at the 2024 North Idaho Film Festival (noidff.com).

The story dives deep into themes of family, legacy, and self discovery, offering viewers a heartfelt narrative that resonates on multiple levels. What sets Inherited apart is its ability to blend raw emotion with imaginative storytelling, drawing audiences into its world with ease.
The cinematography, though simple, reflects a thoughtful eye for detail. Every scene feels purposeful, capturing both the emotion of the characters’ journeys and the broader stakes of the narrative. The performances are genuine, a testament to the strong direction and connection between the cast and the material.
One of the film’s most admirable qualities is its authenticity. Knowing the backstory that Smith created this film independently with little outside help adds a layer of appreciation for the sheer effort behind it. The screening, organized by Smith’s supportive mother, highlights the community and family spirit that surrounds this project, making it even more inspiring.
Inherited is not just a movie; it’s a glimpse into the budding genius of a filmmaker with enormous potential. As Yoshua Smith moves forward in their career, this film will undoubtedly remain a cherished first step. For those who enjoy heartfelt storytelling and innovative indie filmmaking.",9.0

1376721,Final Vows,"In a stressful, complicated age such as this, there’s much to be said for wanting to pursue a quiet, contemplative life, the attraction to which can be quite strong once one gets a taste of it. So it is for the Cistercian sisters of the Santa Rita Abbey, who reside in a modest monastic compound in the idyllic, stunningly beautiful high desert of southern Arizona. These remarkable women, profiled in filmmaker Victoria Westover’s intimate and revelatory new documentary, have freely chosen to commit themselves to this humble, stable and dutiful but eminently satisfying way of life by following the Rule of St. Benedict in service to God. Filmed over the course of four years, the director has captured an inside look at this little-seen order of devotees to the Divine through interviews with the sisters and footage of their everyday lives. The film thus presents a wide-ranging view of monastic life that is likely to be far different from what one might expect. This overview includes both the spiritually introspective elements of their existence, as well as the practical aspects of daily living, such as their work in manufacturing communion wafers, the abbey’s primary source of income. In turn, the film also shows how the sisters’ choice of this calling serves as a means to explore and discover their individual purpose in life through understanding their relationship with God. To this end, they have each taken different paths to get where they are, but the bottom line in each case is the same: finding one’s place in life and leading the existence one is meant to follow in expressing one’s true, authentic self and thereby setting an example for others to follow. In addition, even though the sisters are part of a religious order, their emphasis here appears to be more oriented to a spiritual approach, one less aimed at the group experience of religion and more directed toward the individual expression of spirituality. Consequently, this is something that those who have become disenchanted by dogmatic religious experiences may find refreshing and enlightening, providing a rejuvenated outlook for one’s personal spiritual life. No concerted effort is made here to try and convert anyone to anything; in fact, several of the sisters make a point of noting that the demands associated with a commitment such as this can be substantial, observing that it’s not for everyone, especially in light of the nature of the vows one must take in following through on this process. Interestingly, though, this is not to suggest that this is a dour, ever-serious, thoroughly stringent lifestyle. In fact, it’s portrayed as one filled with love, life and laughter, as seen, for example, in the wry, plainspoken, sometimes-whimsical observations of upbeat, ever-cheerful but self-effacing Prioress Sister Victoria (a.k.a., “Sister Vicki”), reflections of the inherent joy that comes with finding oneself and living a productive and thoughtful life through an experience such as this. As a result of all this, then, “Final Vows” is a truly eye-opening examination of a way of life that carries the tremendous potential for profound satisfaction, fulfillment and peace of mind at a time when those commodities might be hard to find otherwise. It’s a cinematic experience that delivers more than what one might expect at first glance, showing us that there are aspects of life we may well be overlooking and should consider pursuing, even if we don’t follow the same steps as the sisters in achieving that goal. Rather, this is a work that could well prompt us to emulate the inspiration and enlightenment these women have attained – and that we can attain for ourselves, too.",9.0

1372720,I Survive in Farm Merge Civilisation,"[no spoilers]  
""Every masterpiece has it's cheap copy, and Parkour Civilisation was the cheap copy of the incredibly successful and beautiful movie of I Survive In Farm Merge Civilisation"" - Sun Tzu
I Survive In Farm Merge Civilisation is a thrilling retelling of the classical ""Farm"" story that every household around the world grew up with. Possibly the greatest movie adaptation of a popular video game of all time, Farm Merge Civilisation goes above and beyond with all and every single feature.

## Story:  
Unnamed Merger (Voiced by Chris Pratt) has committed multiple felonies and was caught drug trafficking. And alongside his silly friends, it is his goal to run away from the FBI and CIA. This alternative story somehow beats the legendary classical game ""Farm Merge Valley"", in which it was adapted from. The plot continues to unfold in a way that probably can rewrite the art of filmmaking and storytelling itself. Possibly the greatest twist of all time is contained in this movie - something that you should experience yourself. The way the story is delivered in a way which allows the audience to interpret the story by themselves is absolutely ingenious.

## Art:  
Possibly the worst aspect of the movie, I was heavily disappointed to find out that there were no alternative outfits for my characters. Of course, there were the presets of Farmer, Merger and of course Valleyer to name a few. But I was heavily disappointed with the lack of skins. Or perhaps alternative styles to current characters with allows for the exposure of more skin.

## Gameplay:
Shockingly good. Simple to understand. Incredibly original. I would not change a thing about it. This film was great fun with friends and family, with the multiplayer functionality where we all watched in the ""big balls"" cinema.

## Music:
The movie is made for the ""built different"" among us. If you are unable to handle insane greatness or intensely emotional scenes, this film is not made for you. I hear even a second of the I Survive In FARM Merge Valley OST, I break down into tears. Anyone who is in a 50 metre radius will all started sobbing and probably cause a minor flooding.

## Value:

1372008,We Are Faheem & Karun,"**Faheem & Karun: A Delicate Portrait of Queer Love in Kashmir**

_""We Are Faheem & Karun""_ offers a refreshing and authentic portrayal of queer love, a welcome departure from the often stereotypical and sensationalized depictions seen in Indian cinema. Set against the breathtaking backdrop of the Gurez Valley in rural Kashmir, the film delicately unfolds the tender love story between Faheem, a Kashmiri youth with aspirations of opening a restaurant, and Karun, a young Malayali security officer stationed in Kashmir.

The film's strength lies in its nuanced storytelling and the skillful craftsmanship of its crew. It beautifully explores the complexities of love, trust, dependence, and sibling relationships through simple yet powerful scenes. _""We Are Faheem & Karun""_ also provides a poignant glimpse into how life in a conflict zone shapes individuals, impacting their upbringing, family dynamics, and the very nature of love itself. The cast delivers exceptional performances, bringing depth and authenticity to their characters.

1370743,White with Fear,"Many of us would likely agree that “truth” is a hard commodity to come by these days, especially in political and social matters. One need only look to the increasingly bombastic claims coming from each end of the spectrum to see that their agendas and perspectives are being driven by their respective polarized viewpoints, some of which probably contain kernels of truth but that have been significantly enhanced with ample doses of hyperbole and exaggeration. So what are we to believe? That’s a good question, one that this latest documentary from director Andrew Goldberg seeks to address, primarily from the standpoint of how right-wing conservative media and politicians have been deliberately engineering well-orchestrated campaigns of disinformation/propaganda/indoctrination (choose whatever word best suits you) to sway the hearts and minds of a largely uninformed and unquestioning public. Beginning with the Nixon presidency and continuing to the present day, this constituency’s game plan, according to an array of observers and experts, has been (and still is) based on implementing programming designed to play on the fears of White Americans who have come to believe they are targets for ever-increasing degrees of victimization and marginalization. Isolated incidents are blown out of proportion to make them seem like the norm, and threats to their well-being are seen as coming from all directions, potential dangers generally attributed to such scapegoats as immigrants, minorities and members of certain religious sects (the specific alleged perpetrators all being easy to figure out). And these dire warnings are typically packaged in gruesome, graphic, frightening detail and embellished with outright fabrications for maximum impact to fan the flames of support for their manufactured validity (after all, fear can be a powerful motivator and source of common ground in scenarios like this). Hence, individuals who might ordinarily not consider themselves racist or prejudiced are manipulated into viewpoints with which they concur that nevertheless are unwittingly laced with such feelings. Through video clips, sound bites and interviews with analysts of these efforts (as well as former participants in these initiatives), the filmmaker builds what seems to be a damning case against these calculated ventures. However, at the risk of playing devil’s advocate, one could also readily contend that the arguments against these undertakings (by implication) are fundamentally just as potentially biased as the criticisms being leveled here, their own version of the “truth” having been slanted to an opposite but comparable degree. This naturally begs the question, “Where is the objectivity in that?” It also muddies the waters when it comes to finding a suitable answer to the inquiry, “What exactly is the truth here?” While left-leaning viewers will undoubtedly cheer on the discussion raised in this film, the picture nevertheless fails to provide the kind of unblemished clarity and impartiality one might hope for when all things are considered. Sadly, the viewers who might benefit most from screening this release probably won’t see it, having already been conditioned into making up their minds about this subject. And, at the same time, for those who do watch it, this would most likely be seen as a case of preaching to the choir. Regardless of where one’s political leanings may lie, as strong a case as this production might be seeking to make, “White with Fear” ultimately probably won’t provide any of us with the answers we seek either way, and that’s a shame considering how badly we need them these days.",6.0

1353447,"สวยหน้าสด Make Up, Make Me Grow Up!","A movie with a message

I've been a fan of Wayufilm since I started watching BL series and movies, and there are two main reasons. The first is that Nitchapoom ”Nicchi” Chaianoun, screenwriter, director and the owner of Wayufilm, has a very good eye for young talents, and the second is that Nicchi manages to tell stories that touch viewers' hearts without being sentimental. For some time, it looked like Nicchi had lost his instinct for this kind of material, e.g. in some really unpleasant episodes of the ”LGBTQ+ Dramas”, but with short films like ”Make up, make me grow up!”, he's clearly back on track.

”Make up, make me grow up!” tells the story of Up (Nutto Nutdanai), a shy gay boy who is bullied at school because of his spots. When his long-time crush (Fongfong Pathomporn) rejects him, not only because Up is gay, but also because of his allegedly ugly face, Up is so depressed that he's about to jump from a bridge. At that moment, Mek (Jo Ronaporn) comes to his rescue.

Up seeks advice on the internet and covers his spots with make-up, transfers to a different school, and is suddenly popular – until by coincidence his make-up is washed off after he tries to help a bullied boy (Night Yodsakon). As kids gather round him, humiliating him, Mek comes to his rescue once again.

Up and Mek get closer, and after some time, when Mek mainly protects Up, they become boyfriends. Up throws away all the make-up items, after Mek has made it clear to him that Up's appearance doesn't matter to him. With growing self-confidence, the two boys make their relationship public, and are accepted by their peers.

The story isn't really unique – bullying and body shaming have been topics in many other BL series as well. It's the absolutely realistic way the story is told that makes it so lovely – it depicts the ugly side of today's youth culture, with real-life and cyber bullying, with the standards of young people's appearance raised by influencers as well as BL actors, who need to have a perfect face, perfect abs and a perfect look in general, and it shows the despair of boys (and girls) who don't match these criteria, but it also shows that there are still people who don't care about looks, and who aren't evil bullies.

Nicchi succeeds in conveying these messages without ”teaching”, but by showing examples of how to cope with the challenges. Like in most Wayufilm productions, some typical BL elements are there, but Nicchi can do without too many of the nerve wrecking tropes. Okay, there is the ”trip-stare-accidental kiss - stare – stare - stare – shock” trope, and even twice, but they come across (a little) more natural than in many BL series.

All this requires actors who are able to display all the various moods of boys trying to grow up and finding out about their identity, self-esteem, and sexuality, and both leads deliver a natural acting that has been the trademark of many Wayufilm productions, most prominently ”Country Boy” with the iconic couple Oak and Mon, one of the best BL short films ever made. Jo has proven in earlier productions that he's a good actor, and he plays the protective strong boy with the soft heart convincingly. No wonder that the viewer absolutely believes that he can be the shoulder for a boyfriend to cry on. Nutto, however, is a real phenomenon - and hopefully another Wayufilm rising star. Although he's already 24, he is the perfect shy high schooler. When Up is sad, we feel with him, when he's strong, defending a bullied boy, we admire his courage, and when he smiles happily, he makes the viewer smile, too. This is what good acting means. By the way, I suspect that we've been watching Nutto's own story, as he co-wrote the script and also was the make-up artist.

It is astonishing that only two of Nicchi's talents have made their way to big production companies – Fluke Natouch, one of the most popular, and best Thai BL actors, and – to some degree - Fluke Teerapat, who has recently worked more behind the camera and as screenwriter rather than acting. I hope that we'll get to see Nutto and Jo again in lead roles, in another short film at least, and hopefully one day in a full-fledged series.

Directing and cinematography are as good as in most Wayufilm productions, although I'd wish they'd find a different setting for scenes set at Up's home than the Wayufilm headquarters. Anyway, it's good to see that small production companies are able to make movies that can easily compete with high-budget series from big companies.

To sum up – Wayufilm is giving us another nice little short film that isn't shallow, but conveys its message in a sensitive way, and once again with a talented cast.

1353086,"Lijepa večer, lijep dan","When a filmmaker comes up with a good idea for a movie, it’s essential to make sure that all of the key elements are in place when production begins and that carry through into the finished product. This is particularly true for nailing the items intended to have the most impact and eliminating the flotsam that can clutter the final cut. But, in the case of writer-director Ivona Juka’s third feature outing, the filmmaker only gets the formula half right. Without a doubt, Juka scores big on the high-impact material, but the completed work truly could have used another round of script revisions and ruthless film editing to chop out the extraneous material linking these sequences, dead weight that often tends to sink the flow of the picture like an overloaded hammock. This release follows the lives of Yugoslavian director Lovro Horvat (Dado Cosic) and screenwriter Nenad Milicic (Djordje Galic), partners in filmmaking and in life who distinguished themselves as defenders of their homeland during World War II. However, as much as they might like to believe that their combat heroics have insulated them against criticism for their gay lifestyle, they come under growing scrutiny in the 1950s when they attempt to make pictures that are seen as going against the socialist dogma of Yugoslavian leader Marshal Tito. And their “deviant” lifestyle – including alternative “shameful” sexuality, a love of Western music and banned books, and a belief in the existence of free thinking in an allegedly democratic society – provides precisely the kind of trumped up motivation the government needs to surveil them as suspects for traitorous behavior, their wartime accomplishments notwithstanding. Given this context, the story mixes political intrigue and covert spying with tender romantic moments and unforgivably brutal treatment at the hands of merciless official operatives. And it’s in those high-impact moments of warm, loving romance, passionate sexuality, and explicit inhumanity where the director succeeds in making genuinely bold visual and thematic statements, holding nothing back in doing so (sensitive viewers take note for the graphic nature of these depictions). But the in-between moments are when the picture falls decidedly flat, incorporating material that adds little to the narrative and slowing the pace significantly. That’s unfortunate given its otherwise-impressive production values, including strong performances, stunning black-and-white cinematography, a carefully crafted production design, a hauntingly emotive original score and an aptly programmed complementary soundtrack. It also astutely handled re-creations of Yugoslav propaganda films of the era, the kinds of pictures that Horvat and Milicic are relegated to creating when their own projects are sidelined for their “inappropriate” content. These assets, however, are not enough to overcome the deficiencies in the screenplay and film editing (especially the many redundancies in each of these areas), qualities that detract from this offering’s overall quality. Regrettably, these shortcomings get in the way of telling an important (and troubling) tale, one that’s not widely known and that has an eerie relevance in light of recent developments regarding the future of the LGBTQ+ community, not only in the setting of this story, but elsewhere as well. Sadly, acceptance often carries a cost, one that we all need to be aware of through vehicles that make this indisputably clear before it’s too late.",6.0
1341448,कहां शुरू कहां ख़तम,"Kahan Shuru Kahan Khatam is a lighthearted film that marks Dhvani Bhanushali's debut. My experience watching it was a mix of amusement and disappointment, as the film attempts to blend humor with moral lessons but often falls into predictable tropes.

The performances, particularly by Bhanushali, are decent, and the light atmosphere makes it enjoyable for a casual viewing. However, the plot lacked depth and originality, making it feel somewhat formulaic. The music did not stand out either, with a forgettable song featuring Dhanashree Verma that failed to leave an impression.

While the film is aimed at a younger audience and offers some relatable moments, its pacing issues and familiar storyline detract from its overall impact. It works as a one-time watch for those looking for a feel-good experience, but I left wanting more substance and creativity.

Overall, Kahan Shuru Kahan Khatam is an okay film that entertains without making a lasting impression. It’s suitable for light viewing but may not resonate deeply with all audiences.

1336989,Anna y Dante,"Anna and Dante"" is a powerful and raw film that portrays the harsh reality of a society in a Mexican province. With an engaging narrative and flawless direction, this work stands out for its deep sensitivity to contemporary issues. The cinematography, full of symbolism, perfectly complements the film's atmosphere, while the performances authentically convey the emotions of the characters. ""Anna and Dante"" is an independent film of excellent quality, one that not only captivates but also invites reflection on social issues that affect us all.",10.0

1330271,Jimmy,"From 1948 to 1957, author James Baldwin relocated from New York to Paris in hopes of finding a more fulfilling life, both personally and creatively. But what was that experience actually like for a young African-American man who had grown wary of the relentless discrimination he had faced in his homeland, both on the basis of his race and sexual orientation? That’s what this documentary-style release attempts to envision, following a young Baldwin (Benny O. Arthur) in his explorations of the City of Lights, told from an impressionist standpoint primarily in cinema verité format made to look like vintage archive footage. The result is an experimental, decidedly ambitious undertaking from writer-director Yashaddai Owens that works beautifully on some levels but misses the mark on others. “Jimmy” effectively captures the curiosity and wonder of a wide-eyed adventurer exploring a new world, one in which he’s able to enjoy freedoms that weren’t accessible to him in America. It’s a place where he could now feel a sense of liberation unlike anything he had experienced before. However, in depicting these revelations, the filmmaker puzzlingly seems to run out of material unexpectedly quickly, a rather perplexing outcome for a picture with scant 1:07:00 runtime that features an innately flamboyant, charismatic protagonist in a rich, culturally and artistically diverse environment. Instead, the narrative falls back on a lot of footage that feels more like filler than insightful and engaging imagery. In addition, having been filmed in modern-day Paris, far too little effort has been made at trying to conceal or exclude anachronistic elements that get caught on camera, an oversight that some might call nitpicking but that occurs all too often to ignore. Some aspects of Baldwin’s character receive short shrift, too, such as precious little attention paid to the emergence of his gay lifestyle, an element that almost feels intentionally underplayed. The same can be said about his observations of life and the world, material that adds much when incorporated into the film but that is employed far too seldomly for my tastes. However, perhaps the most bewildering element here is the production’s inclusion of a somewhat lengthy home movie-style travelogue of Istanbul at the film’s outset with no images of Baldwin anywhere in sight. While it’s true that the author lived in the Turkish metropolis on and off for many years, he didn’t spend time there until after his days in Paris, so the presence of this footage is quite baffling, ill-timed and, ultimately, fundamentally extraneous. To be sure, “Jimmy” is to be commended for its casting of a lead who bears an uncanny resemblance and demeanor to the picture’s protagonist and for tackling an undertaking as audacious as this, but the end result comes across as a case of the filmmaker’s reach exceeding his grasp for a project that, sadly, deserves better.",6.0
1328737,Vampires Rock: Ghost Train,"A fun little musical/concert film where the jokes fly at the viewer at a quick rate with some over the top silliness thrown in for good measure. Steve Steinman and Lorraine Crosby are on top form as the Baron and his Queen. Full of classic rock songs that will surely get you singing along, Vampire's Rock: Ghost Train is a great little indie production that's pure fun and silly from start to finish.",8.0
1328339,Cheat Meal,"Owen’s girlfriend, Ellie, has been letting their relationship deteriorate ever since she has been following the Svengali-like workout guru Bo. Owen follows Ellie late one night to confront her, but soon discovers that there may be more to Bo’s program than he first expected.

This is a delightful horror short with strong performances by all the actors. Introducing Owen talking about his relationship while talking to a kid on a video game tells us all we need to know about him.

Linc Hand is particularly strong as Bo. He really make’s you believe in Bo’s power with the little screen time he is given.

This short really stood out from the crowd at Popcorn Frights. Try to seek it out, it is well worth 20 minutes of your life.",
1327875,Stomach Bug,"This is quite a poignant short feature from Matty Crawford that adds an extra, more psychological, layer of horror to a story of “Manny” (Leslie Chang). He’s feeling like death so has repaired to the hospital feeling nauseous, but that’s not all that is wrong. His daughter is now an adult, living away, and he misses her. Clearly he has no-one else and in his despair reverts to his own language whilst they speak on the phone - a tongue she doesn’t comprehend. It’s only when he reaches (or maybe wretches) the toilet bowl that we understand more… It’s darkly lit and deals with just as dark a subject matter, as this man’s natural response to his new-found isolation is as scary as anything Hammer might have made.",7.0

It's a unique experience that transports you back in time while keeping one foot firmly in the present. The humor is sharp, and the storytelling is layered with both retro charm and relevant insights, making it a must-watch for fans of 80s culture and those who appreciate a smart, contemporary twist. Whether you're an 80s enthusiast or simply love a good, thought-provoking comedy, this film hits all the right notes.",

TL;DR - Keep having fun enjoying what you do, but be conscious, get involved politically, and vote.",7.0
